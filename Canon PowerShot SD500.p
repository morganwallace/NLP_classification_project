p4
g2
tp5
a(S'A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.'

p13
g11
tp14
a(S'If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.'
p15
g11
tp16
a(S'I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.'
p17
g11

p19
S'neg'
p20
tp21
a(S'I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.'
p22
g20
tp23
a(S'I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.'
p24
g11
tp25
a(S'I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.'

a(S'The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.'
p28
g11

p30

p38
g2
tp39
a(S'Some more manual control would have been nice.'
p40
g20
tp41
a(S"And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness."
p42
g11
tp43
a(S'Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).'
p44
g11
tp45
a(S'I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.'
p46

p54
g11
tp55
a(S"I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!"
p56
g2
tp57
a(S'The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.'
p58
g11
tp59
a(S'I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.'
p60

tp61
a(S'Sharper pictures.'
p62
g2
tp63
a(S'More detail. More natural color.'
p64
g11

p66
g2
tp67
a(S"It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot."
p68
g2
tp69
a(S"I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking."
p70
g11
tp71
a(S"Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly."
p72
g11
tp73
a(S'The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.'
p74
g20
tp75
a(S'This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.'
p76
g11
tp77
a(S'A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.'
p78
g11

g11
tp83
a(S"Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price."
p84
g11
tp85
a(S"You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me."
p86
g11
tp87
a(S'All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.'
p88
g2
tp89
a(S'I have had the SD500 for less than one week.'
p90
g11
tp91
a(S'After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.'

a(S'After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.'
p102
g20

g11
tp115

p116
g2
tp117
a(S'The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.'
p118
g2
tp119
a(S'Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.'
p120
g2
tp121
a(S'I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).'
p122
g2
tp123
a(S'you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.'
p124
g20
tp125

p126
g2
tp127
a(S'I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect'
p128
g11
tp129
a(S"The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got."
p130
g2
tp131
a(S'If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.'
p132
g11
tp133
a(S'and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.'
p134
g11
tp135
a(S'The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.'
p136
g20
tp137
a(S'I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.'
p138
g20
tp139
a(S'Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.'
p140
g20
tp141
a(S'But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.'
p142
g11
tp143
a(S'Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.'
p144

g11
tp151
a(S'This camera is bulletproof.'
p152
g2

p170
g2
tp171
a(S'great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).'
p172
g2
tp173
a(S"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)"

p178

p226
g2
tp227
a(S'I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.'
p228
g2
tp229
a(S'I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.'

p308
g2
