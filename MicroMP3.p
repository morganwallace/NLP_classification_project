a(S'I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.'
p478
g20
tp479
a(S'The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.'
p480
g5
tp481
