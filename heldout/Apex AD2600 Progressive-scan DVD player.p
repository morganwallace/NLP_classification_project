p10
g2
sS'forget about it .'
p11
g2
sS'to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing .'
p12
g2
sS'while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .'
p13
g2
sS'i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .'
p14
g2
sS'it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .'
p15
g8
sS'this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .'
p16
g8
sS"i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed ."
p17
g2
sS'i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .'

sS"] the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last ."
p20
g2
sS'apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .'

g2
sS'i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .'
p22
g2
sS'it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom .'
p23
g2
sS'i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .'
p24
g2
sS"it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set ."
p25
g4
sS"i 'd recommend against this unit ."
p26
g2
sS'for the most part this is a good dvd player .'
p27
g4
sS"thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats ."
p28
g2
sS'i think you get what you pay for stands true .'
p29
g2
sS'now i know why - they are pieces of junk .'
p30
g8
sS'i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .'
p31
g2
sS"it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait ."
p32
g8
sS"only used for 3 month before it 's down !"
p33
g8
sS'at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .'
p34
g8
sS'what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .'
p35
g2
sS'Product name: Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player'
p36
g2
sS'what the hell is wrong with this thing .'
p37
g8
sS"it plays everything , even vcd 's ."
p38
g4
sS'i find this to be a great feature .'
p39
g4
sS'i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .'
p40
g8
sS'so much packed in a small case and very affordable !'
p41
g4
sS"but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments ."
p42
g8
sS'i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .'
p43
g2
sS'the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .'
p44
g8
sS'the second one is up and running .'
p45
g2
sS'what is up .'
p46
g2
sS'if not i will avoid apex products in the future .'
p47
g2
sS'on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .'
p48
g8
sS"i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself ."
p49
g2
sS'the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .'
p50
g8
sS"it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up ."
p51
g4
sS'the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .'
p52
g8
sS"i 'd look elsewhere ."
p53
g2
sS"this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price ."
p54
g4
sS'it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .'
p55
g4
sS'] black and white only after 1 month of use .'
p56
g2
sS'" you can send it in , but i would n\'t count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .'
p57
g2
sS'the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic \'s and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !'

sS'] great dvd player .'
p60
g2
sS'their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .'
p61
g8
sS'i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .'
p62
g2
sS'] does not play dvds with extra features .. .'
p63
g2
sS'some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !'
p64
g2
sS'this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .'
p65
g2
sS"this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before ."
p66
g8
sS'] retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .'
p67
g2
sS'the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .'
p68
g2
sS'if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .'
p69
g2
sS'seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .'
p70
g4
sS"i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him ."
p71
g4
sS'you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .'
p72
g2
sS'the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .'
p73
g8
sS'80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .'
p74
g2
sS'first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .'
p75
g8
sS'but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .'
p76
g2
sS'very bad quality .'
p77
g8
sS'it works great .'
p78

sS'i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .'
p79
g2
sS'] apex ad2600 .'
p80

sS'no matter the format .'
p81

sS'it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .'
p82
g2
sS'] poor customer service .'
p83
g2
sS'this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .'
p84
g2
sS'we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .'
p85
g2
sS'think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?'
p86
g2
sS'once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .'
p87
g2
sS'do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .'
p88
g2
sS'] disappointing - get what you pay for .'
p89
g2
sS'that is where my satisfaction ends .'
p90
g2
sS'for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .'
p91
g4
sS'sent mine back .'
p92
g2
sS"the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's ."
p93
g4
sS'] worst piece of electronics i ever bought .'
p94
g2

p100
g2
sS'after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .'
p101
g2
sS'] best player for the buck .'
p102
g2
sS'only the cheap and poor would buy one .'
p103
g2
sS'you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .'
p104
g2
sS"i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !"
p105
g2
sS'i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .'
p106
g2
sS'as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .'
p107
g2
sS'small problem .'
p108
g2
sS'simple to use and hook up .'
p109
g4
sS"i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !"
p110
g2
sS"it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player ."
p111
g2
sS'looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .'
p112
g4
sS'you should too .'
p113
g2
sS'i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .'
p114
g2
sS"this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last ."
p115
g2
sS'amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !'
p116
g2
sS"lot 's of other features that i need to find out about ."
p117
g2
sS'i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .'
p118
g2
sS'great feature list , poor reliability .'
p119
g2
sS'i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !'
p120
g2
sS'we \'ve purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .'
p121
g8
sS'well , it was nice while it lasted .'
p122
g4
sS'there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .'
p123
g4
sS'] frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player !'
p124
g2
sS"also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short ."
p125
g2
sS'yup , right back for a refund !'
p126
g2
sS'it will read and play all cd audio disc .'
p127
g4
sS'] moderately impressed .'
p128
g2
sS'at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !'
p129
g4
sS'recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .'
p130
g2
sS'after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .'
p131
g8
sS'i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .'
p132
g4
sS'] good price , bad product .'
p133
g2
sS'it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .'
p134
g2
sS'this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .'
p135
g4
sS"the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd ."
p136
g8
sS"for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player ."
p137
g4
sS'what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .'
p138
g4
sS'one stopped working in february and the other in march .'
p139
g2
sS"amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !"
p140
g2
sS"for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc."
p141
g2
sS"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something ."

g4
sS'for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp'
p143
g2
sS'] you get what you pay for .'
p144
g2
sS'called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .'
p145
g2
sS'i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .'
p146
g2
sS'i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .'
p147
g2
sS'the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .'
p148
g4
sS'then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .'
p149
g8
sS'i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .'
p150
g2
sS'these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .'
p151
g2
sS'] you get what you paid for .'
p152
g2
sS'even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .'
p153
g2
sS"i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !"
p154
g8
sS'] i will give it one more try !'
p155
g2
sS"however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) ."
p156
g2
sS'the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .'
p157
g2
sS'( good going , amazon ).'
p158
g2
sS'save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .'
p159
g2
sS'you could have paid more and got a lot less .'
p160
g2
sS'i was , however .'
p161
g2
sS'the downside -'
p162
g2
sS'well that is not true .'
p163
g2
sS'still no response .'
p164
g2
sS'my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .'
p165
g2
sS'it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .'
p166
g8
sS'] another person who had problem with picture after one use .'
p167
g2
sS"it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice ."
p168
g4
sS"hopefully you wo n't regret ."
p169
g2
sS'] the ad2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .'
p170
g2
sS'do not buy this player .'
p171
g2
sS'i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .'
p172
g8
sS'i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !'
p173
g8
sS'i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .'
p174
g8
sS'the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .'
p175
g4
sS'i am back to using # 1 .'
p176
g2
sS'however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .'
p177
g8
sS'what the heck is up with the 2600 .'
p178
g2
sS"it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much ."
p179
g4
sS'i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .'
p180
g4
sS'clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .'
p181
g2
sS'***************************************************************************'
p182
g2
sS'] for the price , an excellent buy .'
p183
g2
sS'i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .'
p184
g2
sS'tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .'
p185
g8
sS'as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .'
p186
g8
sS"i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now ."
p187
g2
sS'i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .'
p188
g4
sS"i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great ."
p189
g4
sS"weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] ."
p190
g8

p191

sS'features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .'
p266
g2
sS'i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .'
p267
g2
sS'i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .'
p268

sS'i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .'

g2
sS"apex does n't answer the phone ."
p270
g8
sS'all i am looking for is a rebate form !'
p271
g2
sS'while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .'
p272

sS'i bought this thing because it plays everything .'
p273
g2
sS'does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?'
p274

sS'it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .'

p281
g2
sS'i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .'
p282
g4
sS'we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .'
p283
g4
sS"i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks ."
p284
g2
sS"i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) ."
p285
g8
sS"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it ."
p286
g8
sS"let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :"

p300
g8
sS"i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked ."
p301
g8
sS"its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had ."
p302
g4
sS'what a mistake !'
p303
g2
sS'any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .'

g2
sS'i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .'
p311
g8
sS"i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom ."
p312
g2
sS'i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .'
p313
g2
sS'i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .'
p314
g2
sS'i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .'

p317
g2
sS'i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .'

sS'the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .'
p319
g8
sS'save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .'
p320
g2
sS'i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .'
p321
g2
sS'there should have been a recall on this product .'
p322
g2
sS'p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?'
p323

sS'but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .'
p324

sS'pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !'

sS"i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem ."
p343
g2
sS'there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .'

sS'the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .'

p410
g4
sS'] awkward remote ; flimsy build quality .'
p411
g2
sS'i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .'
p412
g2
sS'the plus points are -'
p413
g2
sS'on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .'
p414
g8
sS"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying ."
p415
g4
sS"as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin ."

p420
g2
sS'silverish color really adds a special touch .'
p421
g4
sS'because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .'
p422
g8
sS'and then you will start to belive them .'
p423
g2
sS"so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon ."
p424
g2
sS"amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december )."
p425
g2
sS'the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .'
p426
g4
sS'i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .'
p427
g8
sS"now , i thought it 's time to upgrade ."
p428
g2
sS'after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " .'
p429
g2
sS"i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered ."
p430
g8
sS'then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "'

g2
sS'] this dvd player ruined christmas - twice !'
p432
g2
sS'the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .'
p433
g2
sS"unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything ."
p434
g8
sS'it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .'
p435
g8
sS"it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten ."
p436
g8
sS'it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .'
p437
g8
sS'remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .'
p438
g8
sS"only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath ."
p439
g2
sS"finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !"
p440
g4
sS"so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !"
p441
g4
sS'fair warning - do not buy .'
p442
g2
sS'unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .'
p443
g4
sS'" check out " !'
p444
g2
sS'all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .'
p445

sS'i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .'
p446
g8
sS'] great budget player .'
p447
g2
sS'one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .'
p448
g2

p449
g2
sS'however , it has failed to deliver on quality .'
p450
g8
sS"it 's money down the drain ."
p451
g2
sS'at $ 49 .'
p452
g2
sS'nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .'
p453
g4
sS'it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .'
p454
g4
sS"remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s ."
p455
g4
sS"neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )"
p456
g8
sS'they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .'
p457

p458
g2
sS'most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .'
p459
g4
sS'will never purchase apex again .'
p460
g8
sS'it looks great - and is loaded with features .'
p461
g4
sS'i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .'
p462
g2
sS"player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play ."
p463
g4
sS'by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .'
p464
g2
sS'after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .'
p465
g8
sS'upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .'
p466
g2
sS'there was neither picture nor sound .'
p467
g8
sS'i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .'
p468
g2
sS'you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? "'
p469
g2
sS'annoying .'
p470
g2
sS'this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .'
p471

sS"so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine ."
p475
g4
sS"but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it ."
p476
g4
sS'if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .'

g2
sS"] more trouble than it 's worth times 10 ."
p480
g2
sS'i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .'
p481
g4
sS'be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .'
p482
g2
sS"the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray ."
p483
g2
sS"so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them ."
p484
g2
sS'amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .'
p485
g2
sS'little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .'
p486
g2
sS'i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .'
p487
g2
sS'( i guess only time will tell ? )'
p488
g2
sS'seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .'

g2
sS'have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .'

sS'but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .'
p493
g8
sS'i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .'
p494

sS'i guess you get what you pay for .'

sS'each of the 4 lasted less than six months .'
p498
g8
sS'for the money , get a better quality player .'
p499
g2
sS'and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !'
p500
g4
sS'even viewed cds full of jpgs .'
p501
g4
sS'i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .'
p502
g8
sS'retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .'
p503
g4
sS'comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .'
p504
g2
sS"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel"
p505
g8
sS"the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) ."
p506

sS'spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .'
p507

p515
g8
sS'there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !'
p516
g2
sS'] problems .'
p517
g2
sS"it 's not a big deal for me ."
p518
g2
sS'i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .'
p519
g2
sS'for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .'
p520
g4
sS'i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .'
p521
g2
sS"one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing ."
p522
g8
sS'purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .'
p523
g8
sS"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !"
p524
g4
sS'no way to contact their customer service .'
p525
g8
sS'] plays anything .'
p526
g2
sS'new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .'
p527
g8
sS"do n't waste your money ."
p528
g2
sS'i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .'
p529
g2
sS'i can only hear the sound but no picture !'
p530
g8
sS'but heck it plays my alias dvds .'
p531
g2
sS'i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .'
p532
g2
sS'if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !'
p533
g2
sS'i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .'
p534
g2
sS'i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine .'
p535
g2
sS'my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .'
p536
g8
sS"apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone ."
p537
g8
sS"i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas ."
p538
g2
sS'still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !'
p539
g4
sS'i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .'
p540
g8
sS'i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .'
p541
g2
sS'1 .'
p542
g2
sS"i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy ."
p543
g4
sS'what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .'
p544
g8
sS'the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .'
p545
g8
sS'nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .'
p546
g8
sS'i bought this for my dad for christmas .'
p547
g2
sS'] only lasted a month !'
p548
g2
sS'i wish i could give negative stars !'
p549
g2
sS"so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's ."

sS"] people with video issue 's ."
p554
g2
sS'the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "'
p555
g8
sS'the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .'
p556
g2
sS'] isacc l. fisher was wrong .'
p557
g2
sS'now i may buy two !'
p558
g2
sS'i will say this .'
p559
g2
sS'having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .'
p560
g8
sS"this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it ."
p561
g8
sS'spend the money its well worth it .'
p562
g2
sS'do not recommend .'
p563
g2
sS'i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).'
p564
g2
sS'if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .'
p565
g2
sS'i will never buy another apex digital product !'
p566

sS'the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .'

g8
sS'2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .'
p569
g8
sS'and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?'
p570
g4
sS'] piece of crap .. .'
p571
g2
sS"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box ."
p572
g4
sS'set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .'
p573
g2
sS'now i need to buy myself another one !'
p574
g2
sS'so far not going to get a good review .'
p575
g2
sS'the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .'
p576
g4
sS'there are a lot of things i like about it .'
p577
g4
sS'i am still trying to resolve it four months later .'
p578
g2
sS'when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !'
p579
g8
sS"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches ."
p580
g8
sS"either way , can 't go wrong with this price ."

g4
sS"many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player ."

g4
sS'progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .'
p589
g4
sS'i am really impressed by this dvd player .'
p590
g4
sS'i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .'
p591
g8
sS"i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point ."
p592
g2
sS'friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .'
p593
g2
sS"] when it works , it 's great , when it does n't it 's frustrating ."
p594
g2
sS'output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .'
p595
g4
sS'] returned after failing to play dvds .'
p596
g2
sS'i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .'
p597
g2
sS"and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !"
p598
g8
sS'ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .'
p599
g2
sS'consider it for a future gift too !'
p600
g2
sS"that 's a rare and valuable feature ."
p601
g4
sS'i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .'
p602
g2
sS'" enjoy " !'
p603
g2
sS'anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .'
p604
g2
sS'] great - for the first three hours .'
p605
g2
sS'the case had ad2600 .'
p606
g2
sS"basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used ."
p607

sS'] most bang for the buck. i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent .'
p608
g2
sS"the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least ."

p613
g2
sS'- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .'
p614
g8
sS"this is the best dvd player i 've purchased ."
p615
g4
sS'well worth the money .'
p616
g2

sS"without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen ."
p620
g4
sS'3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .'
p621
g8
sS'also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).'
p622
g8
sS'it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .'

p626

p627
g8
sS'before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .'
p628
g2
sS'i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .'
p629
g4
sS'i should have looked at it harder .'
p630
g2
sS'] stay away from it .'
p631
g2
sS'less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "'
p632

p633

sS"there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) ."
p634
g8
sS'the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .'
p635
g8
sS'bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .'
p636
g2
sS'hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . "'
p637
g2
sS'i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .'
p638
g8
sS'the door would not close .'
p639
g8
sS'obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .'
p640

p682

sS'after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .'

p684

sS'i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .'
p685
g2
sS'it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .'
p686

sS'mixed bag i guess but the price was right .'
p689
g4
sS'what more could you ask for .'
p690

p704
g2
sS'3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .'
p705
g2
sS'] fantastic bargain !'
p706

sS'unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .'
p707
g8
sS'i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .'
p708
g2
sS'i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .'
p709

p717
g2
sS'having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " !'

p727
g2
sS"i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it ."
p728
g2
sS'the entire unit was poorly crafted .'
p729
g8
sS'i would recommend buying one .'
p730
g2
sS'however , i should have followed my instincts :'
p731
g2
sS"the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated ."
p732
g8
sS'this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .'
p733
g8
sS'guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .'
p734
g2
sS'perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands .'
p735
g2
sS"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents ."
p736
g4
sS'finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .'
p737
g8

g2
sS'one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .'
p742
g8
sS"i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you ."
p743
g2
sS'i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .'
p744
g2
sS'the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .'
