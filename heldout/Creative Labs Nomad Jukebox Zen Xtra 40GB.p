p2
sS'i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .'
p3
S'pos'
p4
sS'first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .'
p5
S'neg'
p6
sS'difficult navigation - i wo n\'t necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n\'t enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .'
p7
g6
sS'* software is absolutely terrible :'
p8
g6
sS'first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .'
p9
g4
sS'construction quality is a difficult item .'
p10
g2
sS"they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use ."
p11
g4
sS'for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .'
p12
g2
sS"buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) ."
p13
g2
sS'- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price'
p14
g4
sS'the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .'
p15
g6
sS'] awesome .'
p16
g2
sS"creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery ."
p17
g2
sS"it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly ."
p18
g6
sS"( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )"
p19
g2
sS'none of these are perfect .'
p20
g2
sS'] impressed !'
p21
g2
sS'zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .'
p22
g4
sS'mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .'
p23
g2
sS'great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes'
p24
g4
sS'c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said'
p25
g6
sS'so what ?'
p26
g2
sS"and also , it 's priced very affordably ."
p27
g4
sS'* removable battery'
p28
g4
sS'i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .'
p29
g2
sS'it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .'
p30
g4
sS'i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .'
p31
g2
sS'overall , a very disappointing product .'
p32
g6
sS'often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .'
p33
g2
sS"i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard ."
p34
g6
sS"red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software ."
p35
g2
sS'this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .'
p36
g2
sS'unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .'
p37
g2
sS'enjoy .'
p38
g2
sS'the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .'
p39
g6
sS'the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .'
p40
g2
sS'what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .'
p41
g6
sS'enjoy !'
p42
g2
sS'another plus in my book , no file limits !'
p43
g4
sS"that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty ."
p44
g2
sS'stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .'
p45
g2
sS'controls are a bit awkward .'
p46
g6
sS"updating the unit 's firmware :"
p47
g2
sS'like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .'
p48
g2
sS'it happened to me once .'
p49
g2
sS"first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. ."
p50
g4
sS'could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen .'
p51
g2
sS'sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .'
p52
g4
sS'seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .'
p53
g6
sS'i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .'
p54
g2
sS'+ screen was good , easy to read'
p55
g4
sS'with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .'
p56
g2
sS'my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .'
p57
g2
sS"i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs ."
p58
g4
sS'otherwise , this player is awesome !'
p59
g4
sS'however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .'
p60
g2
sS'yes .'
p61
g2
sS'get one now !'
p62
g2
sS'advertising pays off i guess .. .'
p63
g2
sS'you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .'
p64
g2
sS'the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .'
p65
g6
sS'and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .'
p66
g2
sS'in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .'
p67
g2
sS'the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .'
p68
g4
sS'the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )'
p69
g6
sS'conclusion :'
p70
g2
sS'] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .'
p71
g2
sS'i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .'
p72
g2
sS'( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )'
p73
g2
sS"if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't ."
p74
g2
sS'it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .'
p75
g6
sS'i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .'
p76
g2
sS'but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .'
p77
g4
sS'it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .'
p78
g2
sS"i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices ."
p79
g2
sS'hehe , my bad .'
p80
g2
sS'now getting back to this .'
p81
g2
sS'the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .'
p82
g2
sS'i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .'
p83
g2
sS'the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .'
p84
g2
sS'a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .'
p85
g2
sS'] yet another inferior knockoff .'
p86
g2
sS'now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .'
p87
g2
sS"yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) ."
p88
g2
sS"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) ."
p89
g6
sS'in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .'
p90
g2
sS'it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .'
p91
g2
sS'+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit'
p92
g4
sS"all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand ."
p93
g4
sS'the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .'
p94
g2
sS"at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + ."
p95
g2
sS"you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it ."
p96
g2
sS'it was impossible to do so before .'
p97
g2
sS'most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .'
p98
g2
sS'you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .'
p99
g4
sS"everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies ."
p100
g2
sS'the pros :'
p101
g2
sS'this is ridiculous .'
p102
g6
sS"rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it ."
p103
g2
sS'in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .'
p104
g6
sS"it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy ."
p105
g4
sS'transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .'
p106
g2
sS"it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market ."
p107
g4
sS'i received this as a gift for christmas .'
p108
g2
sS'i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .'
p109
g2
sS'to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .'
p110
g4
sS'i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .'
p111
g2
sS'if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .'
p112
g2
sS'i would recommend this product to anyone .'
p113
g4
sS'the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .'
p114
g2
sS'the interface used could be better designed .'
p115
g6
sS'to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .'
p116
g6
sS"some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive ."
p117
g2
sS'the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .'
p118
g2
sS'if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .'
p119
g2
sS'overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .'
p120
g4
sS'- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .'
p121
g6
sS'] way better than a i-pod !'
p122
g2
sS'i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .'
p123
g6
sS"i do n't think so ."
p124
g2
sS'this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .'
p125
g2
sS'working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !'
p126
g4
sS"i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive ."
p127
g2
sS'huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .'
p128
g4
sS'i have no complaints with this mp3 player .'
p129
g4
sS'only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .'
p130
g6
sS'i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .'
p131
g2
sS"for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase ."
p132
g2
sS"the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple ."
p133
g6
sS'if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .'
p134
g2
sS'and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.'
p135
g2
sS'this is a good deal for music and data storage .'
p136
g4
sS'it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .'
p137
g4
sS'easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this'
p138
g4
sS'artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .'
p139
g2
sS'it worked good for a while .'
p140
g2
sS'if it had the same number of " ? " s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of " ? " s. . .'
p141
g2
sS"2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )"
p142
g2
sS'makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .'
p143
g2
sS'the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .'
p144
g2
sS'the setup and transfer process was cake for me .'
p145
g4
sS'point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .'
p146
g2
sS'not a big hassle as many would have you think .'
p147
g2
sS"the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices ."
p148
g4
sS'there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !'
p149
g6
sS'oh ... one more thing .'
p150
g2
sS'i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .'
p151
g4
sS'if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .'
p152
g6
sS"do n't buy this player ."
p153
g6
sS"veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want ."
p154
g2
sS"i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless ."
p155
g2
sS'when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .'
p156
g2
sS"i forgot , the case does n't fit ."
p157
g6
sS'i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .'
p158
g2
sS"this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me ."
p159
g2
sS"- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't ."
p160
g4
sS"in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered ."
p161
g6
sS"again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you ."
p162
g2
sS'you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .'
p163
g6
sS'all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .'
p164
g4
sS'lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .'
p165
g2
sS'it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .'
p166
g2
sS'connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !'
p167
g4
sS'if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .'
p168
g2
sS'the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .'
p169
g2
sS'i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .'
p170
g4
sS'3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .'
p171
g4
sS"i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it ."
p172
g4
sS'then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .'
p173
g2
sS'to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .'
p174
g4
sS'i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .'
p175
g6
sS'i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .'
p176
g2
sS'zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .'
p177
g2
sS"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck"
p178
g6
sS'i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .'
p179
g4
sS"just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date ."
p180
g4
sS'headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .'
p181
g6
sS"the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !"
p182
g2
sS'scroll bar :'
p183
g2
sS'it was just a problem with the player .'
p184
g2
sS'- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .'
p185
g4
sS"here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one ."
p186
g2
sS'the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !'
p187
g4
sS'kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .'
p188
g6
sS'this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .'
p189
g2
sS'] flimsy product .'
p190
g2
sS'i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .'
p191
g2
sS'so .. .'
p192
g2
sS'i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .'
p193
g2
sS'i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .'
p194
g2
sS'] difficulties with tags .'
p195
g2
sS'but the major problem i had was with the software .'
p196
g6
sS'charged my battery .'
p197
g2
sS'] great mp3 player .'
p198
g2
sS'the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .'
p199
g6
sS'i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .'
p200
g4
sS"the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since ."
p201
g2
sS"2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select ."
p202
g6
sS'i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .'
p203
g2
sS'final verdict :'
p204
g2
sS"nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something ."
p205
g4
sS'i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .'
p206
g2
sS"overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !"
p207
g4
sS'the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .'
p208
g4
sS'if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .'
p209
g2
sS'+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .'
p210
g4
sS'after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .'
p211
g2
sS"what 's going on creative labs ?"
p212
g2
sS'quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .'
p213
g6
sS'just get some new headphones and your set .'
p214
g2
sS'i had no problems following their installation instructions .'
p215
g4
sS'the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )'
p216
g6
sS'summary :'
p217
g2
sS'if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .'
p218
g2
sS"having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there ."
p219
g2
sS'the zen has no stop button .'
p220
g2
sS'there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .'
p221
g2
sS'oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^'
p222
g4
sS"also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability ."
p223
g2
sS"a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room ."
p224
g2
sS'the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .'
p225
g2
sS"if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc ."
p226
g2
sS'the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )'
p227
g4
sS'great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .'
p228
g4
sS"i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )"
p229
g2
sS"can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon ."
p230
g2
sS'other than that this thing is great ...'
p231
g4
sS'i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .'
p232
g2
sS'] a quick update to the new zen nx ?'
p233
g2
sS'i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .'
p234
g2
sS'recommendations :'
p235
g2
sS"i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd ."
p236
g2
sS'i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .'
p237
g2
sS'i cannot recommend it enough ! !'
p238
g2
sS'otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .'
p239
g6
sS"apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) ."
p240
g2
sS'i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .'
p241
g2
sS'i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .'
p242
g2
sS"you 're talking totally different hardware ."
p243
g2
sS"all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since ."
p244
g6
sS'however , the creative software is not real intuitive .'

sS'one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .'
p246
g2
sS'before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .'
p247
g2
sS'please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .'
p248
g4
sS"first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod ."
p249
g4
sS'it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .'
p250
g2
sS'so what are you waiting for ?'
p251
g2
sS'i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .'
p252
g2
sS'my only significant complaint is sound quality .'
p253
g6
sS"first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture ."
p254
g6
sS'the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .'
p255
g4
sS'this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .'
p256
g2
sS"-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best ."
p257
g6
sS'] fantastic piece of machinery .'
p258
g2
sS'so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .'
p259
g2
sS'from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).'
p260
g2
sS'i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).'
p261
g2
sS"cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around ."
p262
g2
sS"this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis ."
p263
g2
sS'as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .'
p264
g2
sS"the software has n't been a hassle for me at all ."
p265
g4
sS"if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two ."
p266
g2
sS'no complaints there .'
p267
g2
sS'these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .'
p268
g2
sS'4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).'
p269
g4
sS'well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .'
p270
g4
sS'the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .'
p271
g6
sS'4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .'
p272
g6
sS'you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .'
p273
g4
sS'usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .'
p274
g2
sS'i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .'
p275
g2
sS'] easy to use , massive storage space , sounds great .'
p276
g2
sS'i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .'
p277
g2
sS'an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .'
p278
g2
sS'2 ) storage capacity'
p279
g4
sS'it referred to a " microsoft jet database engine " error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;'
p280
g2
sS'maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .'
p281
g2
sS'software :'
p282
g2
sS'what a junk .'
p283
g6
sS'as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .'
p284
g4
sS'you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .'
p285
g4
sS'] not able to install .'
p286
g2
sS'when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .'
p287
g2
sS"so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer ."
p288
g2
sS'lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .'
p289
g2
sS'the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .'
p290
g2
sS'1 .'
p291
g2
sS'the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .'
p292
g6
sS'the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .'
p293
g6
sS'it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .'
p294
g6
sS"buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) ."
p295
g2
sS'but the earbuds suck !'
p296
g6
sS'and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .'
p297
g4
sS"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment ."
p298
g6
sS'rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .'
p299
g6
sS'my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).'
p300
g2
sS'also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .'
p301
g6
sS'so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .'
p302
g4
sS"i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review ."
p303
g4
sS'all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .'
p304
g4
sS'but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .'
p305
g4
sS'4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .'
p306
g6
sS'just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.'
p307
g4
sS"it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files ."
p308
g4
sS'the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .'
p309
g6
sS'if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !'
p310
g2
sS'i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .'
p311
g6
sS'i am very pleased so far .'
p312
g4
sS"it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors ."
p313
g2
sS'was it a full moon that night ?'
p314
g2
sS'if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .'
p315
g2
sS'one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .'
p316
g2
sS"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car ."
p317
g4
sS"6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's ."
p318
g4
sS"the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 ."
p319
g4
sS"it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well ."
p320
g4
sS"the player 's mechanics are also flawed ."
p321
g6
sS"if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty ."
p322
g2
sS'also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .'
p323
g2
sS'you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .'
p324
g2
sS'if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .'
p325
g2
sS'i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !'
p326
g4
sS'it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .'
p327
g2
sS"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect ."
p328
g6
sS'the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .'
p329
g6
sS'and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .'
p330
g2
sS"people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection ."
p331
g4
sS'i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .'
p332
g2
sS'of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .'
p333
g2
sS'the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .'
p334
g2
sS'i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .'
p335
g2
sS'- price : see above .'
p336
g2
sS'so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , " if the product seems broken , we cannot help , " or something to that effect .'
p337
g2
sS"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive ."
p338
g4
sS"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so ."
p339
g4
sS'i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .'
p340
g4
sS'fm receiver - it has none .'
p341
g6
sS'the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .'
p342
g4
sS'the cd just has too many problems with win xp .'
p343
g2
sS"reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better ."
p344
g2
sS'6 .'
p345
g2
sS'i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "'
p346
g6
sS'do not buy this product --'
p347
g6
sS"like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it ."
p348
g2
sS"i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet ."
p349
g2
sS'4 .'
p350
g2
sS"the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd ."
p351
g6
sS'i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .'
p352
g2
sS'i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .'
p353
g2
sS"the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again ."
p354
g6
sS"at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air ."
p355
g2
sS'the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .'
p356
g4
sS'i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .'
p357
g4
sS'now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource .'
p358
g2
sS'once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .'
p359
g2
sS'my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .'
p360
g6
sS"so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed ."
p361
g2
sS"i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things ."
p362
g2
sS'use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .'
p363
g2
sS"games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music ."
p364
g2
sS'this thing does its job .'
p365
g2
sS"i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two ."
p366
g2
sS"] not what i 'd hoped ."
p367
g2
sS'i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .'
p368
g4
sS"i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place ."
p369
g2
sS'oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .'
p370
g4
sS'in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .'
p371
g6
sS'btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .'
p372
g2
sS'the sound quality is very good .'
p373
g4
sS"sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?"
p374
g2
sS'6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .'
p375
g6
sS'it did lock up on me a couple of times .'
p376
g2
sS'my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .'
p377
g6
sS'when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .'
p378
g2
sS'the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .'
p379
g4
sS'my first impression was positive .'
p380
g4
sS'10 .'
p381
g2
sS'people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .'
p382
g2
sS'i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .'
p383
g2
sS'ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )'
p384
g2
sS'it also lets you remove songs from the play order .'
p385
g4
sS'actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .'
p386
g4
sS'the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .'
p387
g6
sS"for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some ."
p388
g4
sS'the battery is nice .'
p389
g4
sS'slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .'
p390
g2
sS'1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod \'s " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .'
p391
g4
sS"if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do ."
p392
g2
sS"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !"
p393
g4
sS'is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?'
p394
g2
sS'the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .'
p395
g4
sS'i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .'
p396
g4
sS'considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .'
p397
g4
sS'sheesh ! !'
p398
g2
sS"if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality ."
p399
g2
sS'the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .'
p400
g2
sS'crappy headphones .'
p401
g6
sS'the lcd screen was very large and readable .'
p402
g4
sS"to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year ."
p403
g2
sS'what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .'
p404
g2
sS'so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .'
p405
g6
sS"i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod ."
p406
g2
sS'all in all suprisingly easy to use .'
p407
g4
sS'not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .'
p408
g4
sS'the price / performance looked just right .'
p409
g4
sS'it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .'
p410
g2
sS'the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .'
p411
g6
sS'i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .'
p412
g2
sS'you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .'
p413
g2
sS"i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class ."
p414
g4
sS'my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .'
p415
g4
sS'i was a little disappointed in the low end .'
p416
g6
sS"5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing ."
p417
g6
sS'this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .'
p418
g2
sS'Review Source: amazon.com'
p419
g2
sS'the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .'
p420
g2
sS'you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .'
p421
g2
sS'dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .'
p422
g2
sS'having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .'
p423
g2
sS'* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .'
p424
g6
sS'software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .'
p425
g2
sS"it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves ."
p426
g6
sS'the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .'
p427
g2
sS'] excellent product with a few minor problems .'
p428
g2
sS"and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk ."
p429
g2
sS'i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .'
p430
g2
sS'i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .'

sS'the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .'

p436
g2
sS'but who wants the wires involved .'
p437
g2
sS"i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) ."
p438
g2
sS'you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the " next track " or " previous track " button .'
p439
g2
sS'for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .'
p440
g2
sS'was i just unlucky at that moment ?'
p441
g2
sS'in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .'
p442
g6
sS"it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life ."
p443
g2
sS"the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it ."
p444
g2
sS"the player : it 's silver ."
p445
g2
sS'i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .'
p446
g4
sS'since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .'
p447
g2
sS'if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .'
p448
g2
sS'after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .'
p449
g2
sS'( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )'
p450
g2
sS'if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .'
p451
g2
sS'in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .'
p452
g2
sS"i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all ."
p453
g4
sS'you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .'
p454
g2
sS'my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .'
p455

sS'i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .'

sS'i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .'

p464

sS"i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at ."
p466
g2
sS"however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off ."
p467
g6
sS'the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .'
p468
g2
sS'finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .'
p469

sS'no issues as of yet'

sS'by the way , it looks nice also .'
p479

sS'i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .'
p480
g2
sS'come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .'
p481
g2
sS"hope i 've been of some help ."
p482
g2
sS"now let 's talk about the software ."
p483
g2
sS'details :'
p484
g2
sS'the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).'
p485
g2
sS"do n't drop this unit :"
p486
g2
sS"the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive ."
p487
g6
sS'and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .'
p488
g4
sS'a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .'
p489
g2
sS'on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !'
p490
g2
sS'cons :'
p491
g2
sS'they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .'
p492
g2
sS"the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then ."
p493
g2
sS"do n't buy this thing ."
p494
g2
sS"first there 's the unit itself ."
p495
g2
sS'ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .'
p496
g2
sS'i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .'
p497
g6
sS'transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .'
p498
g4
sS'the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .'
p499
g2
sS'you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .'
p500
g4
sS'ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .'
p501
g2
sS"i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem ."
p502
g6
sS'] it is ok , but .. .'
p503
g2
sS"they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality ."
p504
g4
sS'honestly , i love this player .'
p505
g4
sS"2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous ."
p506
g2
sS'like other reviewers , installation was hell .'
p507
g6
sS'] you will be very disappointed with this product .'
p508
g2
sS'also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .'
p509
g6
sS'i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .'
p510
g2
sS'now i know better .'
p511
g2
sS'that player is a complete piece of sh ***.'
p512
g2
sS'wow , dennis sure is great !'
p513
g2
sS'] a good product .'
p514
g2
sS'if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .'
p515
g2
sS"i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do ."
p516
g2
sS'a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .'
p517
g2
sS"the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple ."
p518
g4
sS'on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .'
p519
g2
sS'you will have a very expensive paperweight .'
p520
g2
sS"if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought ."
p521
g2
sS"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo ."
p522
g4
sS'the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .'
p523
g4
sS'i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .'
p524
g2
sS'11 .'
p525
g2
sS'simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .'
p526
g2
sS'like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .'
p527
g2
sS'hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .'
p528
g2
sS'my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .'
p529
g2
sS'given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .'
p530
g4
sS'i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .'
p531
g2
sS'the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .'
p532
g6
sS'my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !'
p533
g2
sS'now i have to return it and rip all my music again .'
p534
g2
sS'take the time to fill in those tags !'
p535
g2
sS"while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better ."
p536
g2
sS'i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .'
p537
g2
sS'a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .'
p538
g2
sS'the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .'
p539
g4
sS'im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .'
p540
g2
sS'the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .'
p541
g4
sS'with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .'
p542
g4
sS"once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers ."
p543
g2
sS"it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened ."
p544
g2
sS'anyway , on with the review .'
p545
g2
sS'] creative nomad zen xtra 40 gb .'
p546
g2
sS'the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .'
p547
g2
sS'price !'
p548
g4
sS'the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .'
p549
g2
sS'( batteries last longer too ! )'
p550
g4
sS'started ripping and transferring .'
p551
g2
sS'plugged it in .'
p552
g2
sS'the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .'
p553
g4
sS"i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me ."
p554
g2
sS"enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem ."
p555
g6
sS'the storage capacity is great .'
p556
g4
sS'a great buy .'
p557
g2
sS'with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .'
p558
g2
sS'i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .'
p559
g2
sS"i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight ."
p560
g2
sS'extremely convenient .'
p561
g4
sS'both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .'
p562
g4
sS'the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .'
p563
g4
sS"that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability ."
p564
g2
sS'the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .'
p565
g6
sS'storage :'
p566
g2
sS"the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad ."
p567
g4
sS'] great player .'
p568
g2
sS'i love the storage in this thing .'
p569
g4
sS'no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .'
p570
g2
sS'very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .'
p571
g4
sS'5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .'
p572
g2
sS'i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .'
p573
g2
sS"tech support could n't figure it out and gave up ."
p574
g2
sS"i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement ."
p575
g2
sS'not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .'
p576
g2
sS'i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .'
p577
g2
sS'how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?'
p578
g2
sS'assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .'
p579
g2
sS'several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .'
p580
g2
sS'the batteries would not charge .'
p581
g2
sS'( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )'
p582
g2
sS'while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .'
p583
g2
sS'hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .'
p584
g2
sS'within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .'
p585
g2
sS'at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .'
p586
g2
sS'the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .'
p587
g6
sS'being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .'
p588
g4
sS'you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .'
p589
g4
sS"needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product ."
p590
g2
sS'i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .'
p591
g4
sS"there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will ."
p592
g2
sS'well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .'
p593
g2
sS'very simple to use .'
p594
g4
sS'another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .'
p595
g4
sS'my opinions :'
p596
g2
sS'so far so good , no problems , no conversions .'
p597
g2
sS'what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .'
p598
g6
sS'] this thing roxxorz .'
p599
g2
sS'for me , that was the only drawback .'
p600
g2
sS"so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home ."
p601
g2
sS'subsequent behavior even worse .'
p602
g2
sS'the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .'
p603
g4
sS"at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria ."
p604
g4
sS"it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it ."
p605
g4
sS'but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .'
p606
g6
sS'playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .'
p607
g4
sS'for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...'
p608
g2
sS'ipod clearly has the most buzz .'
p609
g2
sS"i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go ."
p610
g2
sS'for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .'
p611
g4
sS'well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .'
p612
g6
sS"my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake ."
p613
g2
sS'i just bought this player today and i already love it .'
p614
g4
sS'1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .'
p615
g6
sS'] creative thinking .'
p616
g2
sS"i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error ."
p617
g2
sS"that 's been my experience ."
p618
g2
sS'third , the poor design continues with the case .'
p619
g6
sS"the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers ."
p620
g6
sS'after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .'
p621
g2
sS'granted this is cheaper than an ipod .'
p622
g2
sS'i really have no complaints over this unit .'
p623
g4
sS"it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine )."
p624
g2
sS'i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .'
p625
g6
sS"basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay ."
p626
g2
sS'i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .'
p627
g2
sS"that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory ."
p628
g2
sS'the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .'
p629
g6
sS'simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .'
p630
g4
sS'software downloads on the site crashed my pc .'
p631
g6
sS'most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .'
p632
g2
sS'one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .'
p633
g4
sS'you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .'
p634
g2
sS'the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .'
p635
g6
sS'my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .'
p636
g2
sS'if you are planning to buy that player , do not !'
p637
g2
sS'* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .'
p638
g6
sS'all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .'
p639
g2
sS'] poor reliability .'
p640
g2
sS'the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .'
p641
g4
sS'it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .'
p642
g2
sS"the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap ."
p643
g6
sS'anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !'
p644
g2
sS'carry your entire collection !'
p645
g2
sS"this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't ."
p646
g2
sS'after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .'
p647
g4
sS"possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery ."
p648
g4
sS'wow .'
p649
g2
sS"i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out ."
p650
g2
sS'weird .'
p651
g2
sS'i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .'
p652
g4
sS'the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .'
p653
g6
sS'i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .'
p654
g6
sS'the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .'
p655
g6
sS'ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .'
p656
g2
sS"the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to ."
p657
g2
sS"there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close ."
p658
g2
sS'lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .'
p659
g2
sS'lastly , the price is fantastic :'
p660
g4
sS"you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own ."
p661
g2
sS'after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .'
p662
g2
sS'i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .'
p663
g4
sS"my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts ."
p664
g2
sS'then sorting the files is easy as pie .'
p665
g4
sS"i think this is it 's biggest flaw ."
p666
g6
sS"not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless ."
p667
g4
sS"did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?"
p668
g2
sS'i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .'
p669
g2
sS"i 've had no problems with the software ."
p670
g4
sS'reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .'
p671
g4
sS'pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery'
p672
g4
sS'after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .'
p673
g2
sS'thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !'
p674
g2
sS"reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item ."
p675
g2
sS'hope i helped !'
p676
g2
sS'this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .'
p677
g6
sS'nothing but hassle with this company .'
p678
g6
sS'i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .'
p679
g2
sS'file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .'
p680
g4
sS'the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 " ) .'
p681
g2
sS'i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .'
p682
g2
sS'the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .'
p683
g4
sS'i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .'
p684
g4
sS"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack ."
p685
g6
sS'i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .'
p686
g2
sS'you have to add them to the playing list .'
p687
g2
sS'5 . the zen does not have a stop button !'
p688
g6
sS'this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .'
p689
g2
sS'the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .'
p690
g2
sS'my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .'
p691
g4
sS"i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want ."
p692
g2
sS'eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours'
p693
g2
sS'you will be sorry if you do .'
p694
g2
sS'i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .'
p695
g2
sS"- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for ."
p696
g4
sS'if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .'
p697
g2
sS'i tried to play the song three times , with no success .'
p698
g6
sS'i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .'
p699
g2
sS'as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .'
p700
g6
sS'boy was i wrong .'
p701
g2
sS'i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player .'
p702
g2
sS"the screen 's large and easily read ."
p703
g4
sS'for the price and features it is really good .'
p704
g4
sS'size and style :'
p705
g2
sS'this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .'
p706
g6
sS'i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .'
p707
g2
sS"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) ."
p708
g4
sS'battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive'
p709
g6
sS'if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .'
p710
g2
sS'reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .'
p711
g2
sS'therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .'
p712
g2
sS'as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !'
p713
g6
sS'i will never buy a creative product again .'
p714
g6
sS"while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc."
p715

p764
g2
sS'since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .'
p765
g2
sS"it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods ."
p766
g2
sS'i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .'
p767
g2
sS'this is all i have to say .'

p778
g2
sS'if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .'
p779

sS'i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .'
p780
g2
sS'while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .'
p781

sS'if it does , ill give up .'
p782
g2
sS"i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields ."
p783
g2
sS'in a quick summation , here is what i found .'
p784
g2
sS'note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .'
p785
g2
sS'now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .'
p786
g4
sS'] fantasic product .'
p787
g2
sS'it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .'
p788
g6
sS'this is a nice feature ( i.e. it \'s early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .'
p789
g4
sS"that 's all for now ."
p790
g2
sS'the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .'
p791
g4
sS'you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .'
p792
g2
sS'the included earbuds were uncomfortable .'
p793
g6
sS'the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .'
p794
g4
sS'i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .'
p795
g4
sS'short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .'
p796
g6
sS'it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .'
p797
g2
sS"the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing ."
p798
g6
sS'1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .'
p799
g2
sS'it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .'
p800
g4
sS'it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .'
p801
g6
sS"but you do n't have to be ."
p802
g2
sS'i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .'
p803

sS'the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .'
p804
g2

p805
g2
sS'so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .'
p806
g2
sS'if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .'

p809
g4
sS'] unmatched quality and beyond cool .'
p810
g2
sS'every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .'

p813
g2
sS"the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )"
p814
g2
sS"that was n't pretty ."
p815
g2
sS'it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .'
p816
g2

p817
g4
sS"i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars ."

p819
g2
sS'i purchased this player last week .'
p820
g2
sS'i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .'
p821
g4
sS'i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .'
p822
g2
sS"do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week ."
p823
g2
sS'however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .'
p824
g2
sS'1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?'
p825
g6
sS"] i do n't see what everyone 's problem is - i love this player ."
p826
g2
sS"if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet ."

g6
sS"before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product ."
p831
g2
sS"] why can 't it be rated zero stars ?"
p832
g2
sS'its great .'
p833
g2
sS'i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .'
p834
g2
sS'creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .'
p835
g6
sS'there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .'
p836
g2
sS'minor gripe .'
p837
g2
sS'naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .'
p838
g4
sS"notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ..."
p839
g2

sS'] the interfacing software is unacceptably bad .'
p841
g2
sS"it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far )."
p842
g4
sS'2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .'

p846

p847
g4
sS"that 's probably a bad thing ."
p848
g2
sS'it also has unproven battery life .'
p849
g6
sS'it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .'
p850
g4
sS'i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox " .'
p851
g2
sS'the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .'
p852
g2
sS'my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .'
p853
g2
sS'navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .'
p854
g4
sS'longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .'

sS'the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .'

sS'- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .'

sS"i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page ."

sS'i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .'
p1183

sS'the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .'
p1184

sS'it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .'
p1185
g4
sS'-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .'

g6
sS'navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .'
p1187
g4
sS'2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "'
p1188
g6
sS'the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n\'t as easy as the ipod \'s , or as " sexy " looking .'
p1189
g6
sS'the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .'

sS"that 's important because i have a lot of music ."
p1195

sS"i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it ."
p1196
g4
sS'- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .'
p1197
g4
sS'the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .'
p1198
g2
sS"as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand ."
p1199
g6
sS'while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .'
p1200

sS"i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it ."
p1201

sS'yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .'

sS'the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .'
p1209
g6
sS'it is a beast .'
p1210
g2
sS"i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose ."
p1211
g6
sS"if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you ."
p1212
g2
sS'the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .'

g2
sS'i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .'

sS'experience :'

g2
sS'the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .'
p1216
g6
sS'] in a word ... amazing i got this for christmas .'
p1217
g2
sS'song transfers were not an issue .'
p1218
g2
sS'i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .'
p1219
g2
sS'how does it sound ?'
p1220
g2
sS'c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .'
p1221
g4
sS'be forewarned .'
p1222
g2
sS'i will just say this :'
p1223
g2
sS'the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .'
p1224
g4
sS'the bottom line :'
p1225
g2
sS"but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product ."
p1226
g2
sS'] nomads are wonderful , but be carefull !'
p1227
g2
sS'bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .'
p1228
g4
sS'i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .'
p1229
g2
sS'the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .'
p1230
g4
sS'one major complaint :'
p1231
g2
sS"the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity ."
p1232
g6
sS"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use ."
p1233
g6
sS'now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .'
p1234
g2
sS'i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .'
p1235
g2
sS'i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .'
p1236
g4
sS'a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .'
p1237
g4
sS'11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player'
p1238
g4
sS'have had the player since xmass and love it !'
p1239
g4
sS'it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .'
p1240
g2
sS'even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .'
p1241
g4
sS'after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .'
p1242
g2
sS'although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .'
p1243
g6
sS'another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .'
p1244
g6
sS'it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .'
p1245
g2
sS'but with a low price , comes lower quality .'
p1246
g6
sS'if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .'
p1247
g2
sS'- best in class sound'
p1248
g4
sS'i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .'
p1249
g2
sS'i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .'
p1250
g2
sS'if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .'
p1251
g2
sS'ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .'
p1252
g2
sS'one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .'
p1253
g2
sS'further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .'
p1254
g2
sS'] the 3 ( ? ! ) month warranty should be a warning .'
p1255
g2
sS'thank you !'
p1256
g2
sS'btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .'
p1257
g2
sS'i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .'
p1258
g4
sS'flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost'
p1259
g2
sS'after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .'
p1260
g2
sS"if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory ."
p1261
g2
sS'my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .'
p1262
g6
sS'although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .'
p1263
g4
sS"i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever ."
p1264
g4
sS'cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .'
p1265
g6
sS"i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer ."
p1266
g2
sS"i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive ."
p1267
g2
sS'so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .'
p1268
g2
sS'still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .'
p1269
g2
sS'one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .'
p1270
g2
sS'also , i can \'t understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .'
p1271
g6
sS'features that would have been nice :'
p1272
g2
sS'it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .'
p1273
g6
sS"3 . it 's a hazard in the car ."
p1274
g2
sS'7 .'
p1275
g2
sS"apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly ."
p1276
g2
sS'i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .'
p1277
g2
sS'all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .'
p1278
g2
sS'over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .'
p1279
g2
sS"i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times ."
p1280
g6
sS'the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .'
p1281
g2
sS'but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .'
p1282
g2
sS'karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .'
p1283
g2
sS"software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut ."
p1284
g6
sS'and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..'
p1285
g2
sS'they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .'
p1286
g4
sS'this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .'
p1287
g2
sS'1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .'
p1288
g4
sS'i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .'
p1289
g2
sS'to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .'
p1290
g2
sS'after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .'
p1291
g2
sS'this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .'
p1292
g2
sS'usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .'
p1293
g2
sS'] impressive with few flaws .'
p1294
g2
sS'] zen versus ipod .'
p1295
g2
sS'up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .'
p1296
g6
sS"the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it ."
p1297
g6
sS"it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive ."
p1298
g2
sS'* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).'
p1299
g6
sS'i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .'
p1300
g4
sS'huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .'
p1301

sS'the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .'
p1302
g2
sS'this would have been much easier .'
p1303

sS'if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .'

sS'review of zen xtra - 40 gb'
p1309
g2
sS'finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .'
p1310
g6
sS'sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .'
p1311
g4
sS"i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb ."
p1312
g2
sS'you know why ?'
p1313
g2
sS'whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .'
p1314
g2
sS"i have n't figured it out yet ."
p1315
g2
sS'] excellent product .'
p1316
g2
sS'the nomad is sent back to creative labs .'
p1317
g2
sS"i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to ."
p1318
g2
sS'] an ipod killer :'
p1319
g2
sS'its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.'
p1320
g4
sS'there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .'
p1321
g4
sS'creative provided e-mail support ;'
p1322
g2
sS'having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .'
p1323

p1324
g4
sS'- large easy readable screen'
p1325
g4
sS'what kind of product goes out within a month ?'
p1326
g2
sS'so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .'
p1327
g2
sS'the warranty is 90 days .'
p1328
g2
sS'2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .'
p1329
g6
sS"my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them ."
p1330
g6
sS'the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .'
p1331
g2
sS'3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players'
p1332
g6
sS'] good value .'
p1333
g2
sS'even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .'
p1334
g2
sS'it may have taken several years to fill this up .'
p1335
g2
sS'it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .'
p1336
g4
sS'i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .'
p1337
g2
sS'a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .'
p1338
g2
sS'well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .'
p1339
g2
sS'] software problem .'
p1340
g2
sS"my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes ."
p1341
g2
sS'this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .'
p1342
g2
sS'] the bundled software blows , yes ... ... but i heard of notmad explorer ( http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people .'
p1343
g2
sS'read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !'
p1344
g2
sS'when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .'
p1345
g4
sS'if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .'
p1346
g4
sS'to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;'
p1347
g2
sS"i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well ."
p1348
g4
sS"they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck ."
p1349
g2
sS'they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .'
p1350
g6
sS'after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :'
p1351
g2
sS'when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .'
p1352
g2
sS"i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive ."
p1353
g2
sS'] depressingly poor quality .'
p1354
g2
sS'the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .'
p1355
g2
sS'i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .'
p1356
g2
sS'maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .'
p1357
g2
sS'the other controls are all very easy to use .'
p1358
g4
sS'i guess that \'s why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing .'
p1359
g2
sS'finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .'
p1360
g4
sS'zen good points :'
p1361
g2
sS'i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .'
p1362
g4
sS'i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .'
p1363
g4
sS'i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .'
p1364
g2
sS'3 ) user replaceable battery'
p1365
g4
sS'because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .'
p1366
g4
sS'] good for the money , but software is awful .'
p1367
g2
sS'the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .'
p1368
g2
sS'so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .'
p1369
g2
sS'hmmmmm ....'
p1370
g2
sS"here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :"
p1371
g2
sS"now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home ."
p1372
g2
sS"the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day ."
p1373
g6
sS"so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life ."
p1374
g2
sS"so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden ."
p1375
g2
sS'well that was not a simple task .'
p1376
g2
sS'finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .'
p1377
g2
sS'compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .'
p1378
g4
sS'not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .'
p1379
g4
sS"that takes up half the space of mp3 's ."
p1380
g2
sS"it 's a shame , but mine is going back ."
p1381
g2
sS'the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .'
p1382
g2
sS'notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .'
p1383
g2
sS'it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .'
p1384
g6
sS'note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it'
p1385
g2
sS"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long ."
p1386
g4
sS'it says i have a harddisk problem .'
p1387
g2
sS'its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .'
p1388
g6
sS'sure it \'s " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i \'ll save around 250 bucks .'
p1389
g2
sS'now we come to the zen xtra .. .'
p1390
g2
sS"it 's horrible ."
p1391
g2
sS'after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .'
p1392
g2
sS"it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used ."
p1393
g2
sS'if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .'
p1394
g2
sS'i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .'
p1395
g2
sS'the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .'
p1396
g2
sS'mediasource did not recognize my tags !'
p1397
g6
sS"i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for ."
p1398
g6
sS"even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out ."
p1399
g6
sS'basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .'
p1400
g2
sS"i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players ."
p1401
g4
sS'a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .'
p1402
g2
sS'i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .'
p1403
g2
sS"if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. ."
p1404

g6
sS"i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up ."
p1644

sS'creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .'
p1645

sS'everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .'
p1646
g2
sS'the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .'
p1647
g2
sS'the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .'
p1648

sS'that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .'

sS'i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .'

sS"i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) ."
p1656
g4
sS'you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .'
p1657
g2
sS'the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .'
p1658
g4
sS'you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .'
p1659
g2
sS'good thing i got a replacement plan .'

sS'i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .'

p1684

sS'i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .'
p1685
g6
sS'two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .'
p1686
g2
sS'while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .'
p1687
g2
sS'1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .'
p1688
g6
sS'try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .'

sS'it was no problem for me to use their software .'
p1695
g4
sS"get it , it 's woth every penny ! !"
p1696
g4
sS'first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .'

p1705

sS'] ipod vs nomad zen xtra'
p1708
g2
sS'solution ?'
p1709

sS'and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .'
p1710

sS'is my unit defective ?'
p1711
g2
sS"i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive ."
p1712
g4
sS"the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver ."
p1713
g2
sS'if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .'
p1714
g2
sS'the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .'
p1715
g6
sS'the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .'
p1716
g6
sS'however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .'
p1717
g6
sS"- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well"
p1718
g6
sS'if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .'

p1720
g2
sS'if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .'
p1721
g2
sS'the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .'
p1722
g4
sS'f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course'
p1723
g6
sS'the controls definately took some getting used to .'
p1724
g2
sS'at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .'
p1725
g6
sS"the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck ."
p1726
g6
sS"i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes ."
p1727
g2
sS'great price .'
p1728
g4
sS'3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .'
p1729
g6
sS'battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .'
p1730
g4
sS'again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .'
p1731
g2
sS'it can get pretty lonely out there .'
p1732
g2
sS'perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .'
p1733
g2
sS"you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications ."
p1734
g2
sS'those that have it like it .'

sS'] good player , but this technology is not yet great .'

sS'b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display'
p1739
g6
sS'there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .'
p1740
g4
sS'ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .'
p1741
g4
sS'it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .'
p1742
g2
sS"all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) ."
p1743
g4
sS'd ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on'
p1744
g6
sS'buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .'
p1745
g2
sS'] perfect purchase .'
p1746
g2
sS'based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .'
p1747
g2
sS'- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .'
p1748
g6
sS'i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .'
p1749
g2
sS'the price compared to the ipod is great .'
p1750
g4
sS'the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .'
p1751
g6
sS'the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .'
p1752
g4
sS'it was not my first choice .'
p1753
g2
sS'the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .'
p1754
g4
sS'also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .'
p1755
g2
sS'it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .'
p1756
g2
sS"meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list ."
p1757
g2
sS'so now i keep it in my pocket .'

sS'i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )'

sS'of course you do !'
p1763

sS'the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .'
p1764
g6
sS'unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "'
p1765
g6
sS'the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .'
p1766
g4
sS'bottom-line :'
p1767
g2
sS'even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .'
p1768
g2
sS'having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .'
p1769
g2
sS'flaws :'
p1770
g2
sS"i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive ."
p1771
g6
sS'this did not give me enough control .'
p1772
g2
sS'for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .'
p1773
g4
sS"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun ."
p1774
g4
sS'transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .'
p1775
g4
sS'since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .'
p1776
g4
sS"so consider what you 're going to use the device for ."
p1777
g2
sS'synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .'

sS'pros :'

p1785

sS'but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .'
