sS'this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .'
p9
g7
sS"this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly ."
p10
g7
sS'my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .'
p11
g7
sS'so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .'
p12

p21
g2
sS']excellent , but only gsm ?'
p22
g2
sS'great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .'
p23
g2
sS'i was immediately interested in the 6610 .'
p24
g2
sS'the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !'
p25
g2
sS'if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .'
p26

p30

sS"the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much ."

sS'ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .'
p39
g14
sS'the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .'
p40
g7
sS'both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .'
p41
g2
sS'i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .'

p43
g2
sS"this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. ."
p44
g2
sS'as said before this works perfectly .'
p45
g7
sS'this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .'
p46
g2
sS"here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth ."
p47
g2
sS'so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .'
p48
g2
sS'also , they \'d forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .'

g2
sS'cons :'
p51
g2
sS'the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .'
p52
g7
sS'oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .'
p53
g2
sS'go for it !'
p54
g2
sS'it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .'
p55

sS'please !'

g2
sS'" i \'m not sure " . ) .'
p57
g2
sS'i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .'
p58
g2
sS'first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .'
p59
g7
sS"the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be ."
p60
g14
sS"i 've yet to be dissappointed ."
p61

sS'great phone .. .'
p62
g7
sS'no big deal for the size . .'
p63
g2
sS'the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .'

sS'it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .'
p65
g7
sS'it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .'
p66
g2
sS'i like the default blue .'
p67
g2
sS"the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use ."
p68
g2
sS'after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .'
p69
g2
sS'i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .'
p70
g2
sS'after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !'
p71
g14
sS'- excellent sound quality'
p72
g7
sS"radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in ."
p73
g2
sS'the title says it all ...'
p74
g2
sS'i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .'
p75
g7
sS'oh my goodness --'
p76
g2
sS'the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .'
p77
g2
sS'if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .'
p78
g2
sS'              University of Illinois at Chicago'
p79
g2
sS'this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .'
p80
g7
sS"so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option ."
p81
g14
sS"i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 ."
p82
g2
sS'the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .'
p83
g2
sS']nokia 6610 great for games and ringtones .'
p84
g2
sS'i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :'
p85
g2
sS'only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .'
p86
g14
sS'worth every penny !'
p87
g2
sS'battery life :'
p88
g2
sS']ultimate phone for mobile life .'
p89
g2
sS'but , i would definately recommend this phone .'
p90
g7
sS'overall design :'
p91
g2
sS'- bright , visible screen'
p92
g7
sS"the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact ."
p93
g2
sS"people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone ."
p94
g2
sS'although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .'
p95
g7
sS'using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .'
p96
g2
sS'this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .'
p97
g7
sS'people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .'
p98
g2
sS'the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .'
p99
g7
sS'only con i can think of is no camera ... .'
p100
g14
sS'yes , the features are numerous .'
p101
g7
sS'nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .'
p102
g7
sS'anything this phone does , it does perfectly .'
p103
g7
sS'on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .'
p104
g7
sS'i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .'
p105
g14
sS'yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .'
p106
g2
sS'if you have a question , they have the answer .'
p107
g2
sS'just make sure the keys are locked .'
p108
g2
sS'no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .'
p109
g2
sS'this is the best phone i have seen .'
p110
g7
sS'one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !'
p111
g14
sS'not many .'
p112
g2
sS'to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .'
p113
g2
sS'the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .'
p114
g14
sS'anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .'
p115
g7
sS'the t610 has the most functionality hands down .'
p116
g2
sS'i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .'
p117
g2
sS'the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .'
p118
g7
sS'it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .'
p119
g2
sS'i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .'
p120
g2
sS"i do n't really like bounce ."
p121
g2
sS'word ... peace in the east bruvah .'
p122
g2
sS'i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .'
p123
g7
sS'nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .'
p124
g7
sS'other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .'
p125
g7
sS'just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .'
p126
g2
sS'i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .'
p127
g2
sS'i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .'
p128
g7
sS'some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .'
p129
g14
sS'every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .'
p130
g2
sS'personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .'
p131
g2
sS'also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .'
p132
g14
sS'the fm radio is cool .'
p133
g7
sS'the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .'
p134
g7
sS"i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it ."
p135
g2
sS'i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .'
p136
g7
sS'the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .'
p137
g2
sS'it is small .'
p138
g7
sS'now , for the t-mobile service :'
p139
g2
sS'nokia does not disappoint in this model .'
p140
g7
sS'overall this is a slightly better than average phone .'
p141
g7
sS']i really think .'
p142
g2
sS'***************************************************************************'
p143
g2
sS'negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .'
p144
g14
sS"after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform ."
p145
g2
sS'but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .'
p146
g7
sS'small size .'
p147
g7
sS'that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .'
p148
g2
sS'two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .'
p149
g2
sS"it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !"
p150
g14
sS'i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .'
p151
g2
sS'the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .'
p152
g14
sS'since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .'
p153
g14
sS'signal strength will affect the battery life .'
p154
g2
sS'and how can i do that ... .'
p155
g2
sS"i did n't had any problem till now ."
p156
g2
sS"i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators ."
p157
g2
sS'i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .'
p158
g2
sS'i have been assured this will be fixed soon .'
p159
g2
sS'wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !'
p160
g2
sS'that is a major minus , but its not that bad .'
p161
g2
sS'prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .'
p162
g2
sS']good phone , so-so service .'
p163
g2
sS'you have to buy better ones .'
p164
g2
sS"i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional ."
p165
g7
sS'if you thought about getting this phone buy it .'
p166
g2
sS'vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .'
p167
g2
sS'the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .'
p168
g7
sS'on an average , you would charge it once a week .'
p169
g2
sS"but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle ."
p170
g2
sS'only if we could get one camera in it . .'
p171
g14
sS'most of our emplyees use this model phone .'
p172
g2
sS'the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .'
p173
g7
sS'i have had this phone for about 5 months .'
p174
g2
sS'i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .'
p175
g2
sS"i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down ."
p176
g2
sS'one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .'
p177
g14
sS'the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .'
p178
g7
sS'overall an excellent phone .'
p179
g7
sS"when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :"
p180
g14
sS"however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line ."
p181
g14
sS'when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .'
p182
g7
sS"nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them ."
p183
g7
sS'i like the size and weight of this little critter .'
p184
g7
sS'- no propietary headset jack'
p185
g14
sS'bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .'
p186
g2
sS'it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .'
p187
g7
sS"this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands ."
p188
g14
sS"the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing ."
p189
g7
sS'in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .'
p190
g7
sS'it defaulted to unchangeable email .'
p191
g2
sS']it works ... as a phone !'
p192
g2
sS'i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .'
p193
g7
sS'i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .'
p194
g14
sS"i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it ."
p195
g2
sS'personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .'
p196
g2
sS'hope someone else has better luck !'
p197
g2
sS']great phone , but what did you say ?'
p198
g2
sS'i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .'
p199
g14
sS'the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .'
p200
g2
sS'that is a very nice feature .'
p201
g2
sS'i like the speakphone function a lot .'
p202
g7
sS'it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .'
p203
g2
sS']the phone refused to die .'
p204
g2
sS'features :'
p205
g2
sS'not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .'
p206
g7
sS'but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they \'ve answered all your questions , even if they did n\'t , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you .'
p207
g2
sS']cool .'
p208
g2
sS'you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .'
p209
g7
sS'service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .'
p210
g7
sS"the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint ."
p211
g14
sS']great speakerphone and great reception ! ! reccomend !'
p212
g2
sS'or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .'
p213
g2
sS'of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .'
p214
g2
sS'this bumpy is wicked groovy .'
p215
g2
sS'in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .'
p216
g7
sS']i bought 2 .'
p217
g2
sS'in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .'
p218
g14
sS'you can also set a background wallpaper .'
p219
g2
sS']incredibly pleased .'
p220
g2
sS'i have had no problems with the phone .'
p221
g7
sS'is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .'
p222
g2
sS'the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .'
p223
g7
sS'this phone is a winner ...'
p224
g7
sS'i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .'
p225
g2
sS'the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .'
p226
g7
sS'- light , compact design'
p227
g7
sS'the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .'
p228
g2
sS'go for it ...'
p229
g2
sS"the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) ."
p230
g2
sS'their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .'
p231
g14
sS']people with bad audio quality have defective phones .'
p232
g2
sS"i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive ."
p233
g2
sS"the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --"
p234
g14
sS'if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .'
p235
g2
sS"forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !"
p236
g2
sS'they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .'
p237
g2
sS'by what time standards -- martian ?'
p238
g2
sS'any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .'
p239

p240
g7
sS'how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?'
p241
g2
sS'if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .'
p242
g2
sS'- speakerphone'
p243
g7
sS'while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .'
p244
g7
sS'and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .'
p245
g2
sS'just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .'
p246
g2
sS'it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .'
p247

sS'it has 2 games .'

sS'for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .'
p257
g2
sS'nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .'
p258
g2
sS'the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .'
p259
g14
sS'See Readme.txt to find the meaning of each symbol.'
p260
g2
sS'we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .'

sS'i have used this phone for two months now .'

g2
sS'the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .'

sS'they are not wowable good .'
p266

sS'great features . .'
p268

sS']6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand .'
p269
g2
sS'the battery life on this phone is surreal .'
p270
g7
sS'thumbs down on that one .'
p271
g2
sS'when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .'
p272
g7
sS'unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .'
p273
g14
sS'like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .'
p274
g2
sS'it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .'
p275

sS'do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .'

sS'able to use service in another country :'
p277
g2
sS"bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it ."
p278
g2
sS"it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 ."
p279
g2
sS'there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .'
p280
g7
sS'no more annoying series of beeps .'
p281
g2
sS'all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .'
p282
g2
sS'i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .'
p283
g14
sS'poor visibility on the keys .'
p284
g14
sS'as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .'
p285
g2
sS'surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .'
p286
g7
sS'oh well ..'
p287
g2
sS'the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?'
p288
g7
sS'the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .'
p289
g14
sS'the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .'
p290
g7
sS'i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .'
p291
g7
sS'battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .'
p292
g7
sS'the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .'
p293
g2
sS'i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .'
p294
g2
sS"i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal ."
p295
g2
sS']excellent phone , excellent service .'
p296
g2
sS'the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .'
p297
g7
sS'they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .'

sS'really quiet .'

p303
g7
sS'the speakerphone :'
p304
g2
sS'perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .'
p305
g2
sS'this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .'
p306
g7
sS'i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .'
p307
g14
sS"why i do n't can this product without a plan ?"
p308
g2
sS'i highly recommend this phone to anyone .'
p309
g7
sS"the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla ."
p310
g2
sS'although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .'
p311
g14
sS'nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .'
p312
g2
sS'the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .'
p313
g7
sS'also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .'
p314
g2
sS'the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .'
p315
g14
sS'another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .'
p316
g7
sS'i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .'
p317
g2
sS'the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .'
p318
g7
sS']awesome phone choice .'
p319
g2
sS'ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?'
p320
g2
sS'even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .'
p321
g7
sS'sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .'
p322
g7
sS'i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .'
p323
g2
sS'ease of use :'
p324
g2
sS'the radio feature has superb sound quality .'
p325
g7
sS']best phone for free .'
p326
g2
sS"whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio ."
p327
g7
sS'finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .'
p328
g14
sS'he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .'
p329
g2
sS'as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .'
p330
g2
sS'now i can always be in contact .'
p331
g2
sS'i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .'
p332
g2
sS'the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .'
p333
g7
sS'it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .'
p334
g7
sS'recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .'
p335
g2
sS'with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .'
p336
g7
sS'it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .'
p337
g7
sS"yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch ."
p338
g2
sS'the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .'
p339
g7
sS'friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .'
p340
g2
sS'their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .'
p341
g2
sS'the vibrate setting is loud !'
p342
g14
sS'this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .'
p343
g7
sS'the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .'
p344
g7
sS'the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .'
p345
g2
sS'find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .'
p346
g2
sS'the battery life is amazing .'
p347
g7
sS']great plan .'
p348
g2
sS'sold in other parts of the world :'

sS'and really this is the best phone one could have .'
p350
g7
sS'it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .'
p351
g7
sS']cool phone !'
p352
g2
sS'the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !'
p353
g7
sS'the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .'
p354
g14
sS"]do n't have the phone just commenting ."
p355
g2
sS'i am bored with the silver look .'
p356
g14
sS'the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .'
p357
g2
sS'so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )'
p358
g2
sS'every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .'
p359
g2
sS'below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :'
p360
g2
sS'it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .'
p361
g2
sS'regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .'
p362
g14
sS'i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !'

sS'even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .'
p371
g2
sS'this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .'
p372
g7
sS"i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account ."
p373

sS'there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .'

p379
g2
sS'i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .'
p380
g7
sS'more downside to this phone ?'
p381
g2
sS'first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .'
p382
g2
sS'first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .'
p383
g7
sS'the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .'
p384
g7
sS"please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy ."

g2
sS']nokia 6610 .'
p386
g2
sS'i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .'
p387
g2
sS'this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .'
p388
g7
sS'- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .'
p389
g14
sS'print those coupons twice for two phones ?'
p390
g2
sS'that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !'
p391
g2
sS"they piggy-back on cingular 's service ."
p392
g2
sS'the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .'
p393
g14
sS'it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .'
p394
g14
sS'- well-backlit keypad'
p395
g7
sS'navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .'
p396
g7
sS'this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .'
p397
g7
sS't-mobile was a pretty good server .'
p398
g7
sS'battery life is good for a phone of this size .'
p399
g7
sS'i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .'
p400
g2
sS'this phone is highly recommended otherwise .'
p401
g7
sS'Annotated by: Minqing Hu and Bing Liu, 2004.'
p402
g2
sS'it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .'
p403
g7
sS'in all a winning combination .'
p404
g2
sS'i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .'
p405
g2
sS"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands ."
p406
g14
sS'the reception and sound quality are top-notch .'
p407
g7
sS"i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me ."
p408
g2
sS'you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .'

p411
g2
sS'the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .'
p412
g7
sS'i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .'
p413
g2
sS'if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .'
p414
g2
sS'excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .'
p415
g7
sS'it did have scored over all other competitors ....'
p416
g2
sS'other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .'
p417
g14
sS"the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird ."
p418
g14
sS'which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...'
p419
g2
sS'Product name: Nokia 6610'
p420
g2
sS'therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .'

g2
sS']best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) .'

sS"i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back ."

g2
sS"however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off ."
p427
g7
sS']perfect .'
p428
g2
sS'my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .'
p429
g2
sS"one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online ."
p430
g2
sS'however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .'
p431
g14
sS'is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?'
p432
g2
sS'truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !'
p433
g2
sS'it has a nice color screen .'
p434
g7
sS'it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .'
p435
g2
sS'you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .'
p436
g2
sS'anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .'
p437
g2
sS']glad to own .'
p438
g2
sS'the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !'
p439

sS'the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .'

sS'- solid , high-quality construction'
p442
g7
sS'if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .'

sS'its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .'

sS']i love this phone .'
p450
g2
sS"so what 's the point ?"
p451
g2
sS'so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .'
p452
g2
sS"the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network ."
p453
g14
sS"the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) ."
p454
g14
sS'great screen and great sound .'
p455
g7
sS'the phone is very light weight .'
p456
g7
sS'i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .'
p457
g2
sS'for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .'
p458
g7
sS'best regards sadoun satellite sales'
p459
g2
sS'the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .'
p460
g14
sS"i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't ."
p461
g2
sS'i would not give up this phone for the world .'
p462
g2
sS']perfect phone .'
p463
g2
sS'i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .'
p464
g2
sS'i am very pleased with its quality and durability .'
p465
g7
sS'...'
p466
g2
sS'we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .'
p467
g14
sS'- very long-lasting battery life'
p468
g7
sS'this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .'
p469

g14
sS'i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .'
p473
g2
sS'after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .'
p474
g2
sS"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route ."
p475
g7
sS'after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .'
p476
g7
sS'from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .'
p477
g7
sS']great phone , great service , no voice dialing .'
p478
g2
sS"it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out ."
p479
g2
sS"i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !"
p480
g2
sS"the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk ."
p481
g7
sS'i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .'
p482
g2
sS'my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .'
p483
g2
sS'almost there .'
p484
g2
sS'different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .'
p485
g2
sS"buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .."
p486
g14
sS'tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .'
p487
g2
sS'i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .'
p488
g7
sS']best of the best mobile phone .'
p489
g2
sS'my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .'
p490
g14
sS"( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )"
p491
g2
sS'one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .'
p492
g2
sS'it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .'
p493
g2
sS'pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?'
p494

sS"so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates ."
