p5
g2
sS'If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.'
p6
g4
sS"Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price."
p7
g4
sS'I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.'
p8
g4
sS'In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.'
p9
g4
sS"You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me."
p10
g4
sS'A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.'

sS'The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.'
p12

sS"i just thought it's cute and cool =)"
p13
g4
sS'another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.'
p14
g2
sS'LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.'
p15
g4
sS'This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.'
p16
g4

sS'Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.'
p20
g4
sS'Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.'
p21
g4
sS"For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed."
p22
g4
sS"I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera."

p31
g4
sS'Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.'
p32
g2
sS'However, it was not so in my case.'
p33
g4
sS'A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.'
p34
g2
sS"I still can't believe how fast it starts up."
p35
g2
sS'I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect'

p46
g2
sS'Camera powers on and ready in about a second.'
p47
g4
sS'On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!'
p48
g4
sS"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)"

p53
g40
sS"The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got."

sS'I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.'
p57
g4
sS'I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.'
p58
g2
sS'So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.'
p59
g4
sS'All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.'
p60
g4
sS'Wrong, except that my problems are different.'
p61
g4
sS'Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.'
p62

p75
g40
sS'This camera is truely superb.'

sS"I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it."
p82
g4
sS'After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.'
p83

g2
sS'Some more manual control would have been nice.'
p85
g40

g4
sS'The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.'
p90
g2
sS'The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).'

p106
g4
sS'I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.'
p107
g40
sS'change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.'

sS'I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).'

p130
g2
sS'All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.'
p131
g2
sS'I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.'
p132
g4
sS'Good image quality.'
p133

g40
sS'Stored in a padded case.'
p149
g4
sS"I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality."

p172
g4
sS'Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.'
p173
g2
sS"I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking."
p174
g4

g2
sS"I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views."

p187
g2
sS"but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv)."
p188
g4

p193

p203
g40
sS'And the video quality is amazing.'

g4
sS'Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!'
p208
g2
sS'I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).'
p209
g2
sS"It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot."
p210

p211
g2
sS'I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.'
p212
g40
sS'The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.'
p213
g4
sS'Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.'
p214
g2
sS'The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.'
p215
g40

p216
g4
sS'CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.'
p217
g4
sS"I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered."
p218

g2
sS'WOW! Big difference!'
p220
g4
sS'Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.'
p221
g2
sS'I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.'
p222
g4
sS'It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office \x96 where no one goes but me.'
p223
g4
sS'Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.'
