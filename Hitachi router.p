(S'I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.'
p1
S'pos'
p2
tp3
a(S'Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.'
p4
S'neutral'
p5
tp6
a(S'The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.'
p7
S'neg'
p8
tp9
a(S'I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.'
p10
g5
tp11
a(S'The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.'
p12
g8
tp13
a(S'Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.'
p14
g8
tp15
a(S'I never could get the panel bit to fit right.'
p16
g5
tp17
a(S'I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.'
p18
g5
tp19
a(S'From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.'
p20
g2
tp21
a(S'I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.'
p22
g5
tp23
a(S'I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.'
p24
g5
tp25
a(S'But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.'
p26
g2
tp27
a(S'At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.'
p28
g5
tp29
a(S'The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)'
p30
g2
tp31
a(S'However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).'
p32
g8
tp33
a(S"Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it."
p34
g2
tp35
a(S'The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.'
p36
g5
tp37
a(S'Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.'
p38
g8
tp39
a(S'I looked at this router and bought a Makita.'
p40
g5
tp41
a(S'The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.'
p42
g2
tp43
a(S'I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.'
p44
g5
tp45
a(S'If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.'
p46
g8
tp47
a(S"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty."
p48
g8
tp49
a(S'But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.'
p50
g2
tp51
a(S'I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.'
p52
g8
tp53
a(S'Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.'
p54
g5
tp55
a(S'Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.'
p56
g5
tp57
a(S"So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that."
p58
g2
tp59
a(S'Happy woodworking!!'
p60
g5
tp61
a(S"Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router."
p62
g2
tp63
a(S"It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation."
p64
g8
tp65
a(S'Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.'
p66
g5
tp67
a(S'Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.'
p68
g5
tp69
a(S'I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.'
p70
g5
tp71
a(S'And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.'
p72
g5
tp73
a(S'In my table the M12V has been a real champ.'
p74
g2
tp75
a(S"I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees."
p76
g5
tp77
a(S'The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.'
p78
g2
tp79
a(S'With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).'
p80
g8
tp81
a(S'Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)'
p82
g5
tp83
a(S'Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering'
p84
g5
tp85
a(S'The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.'
p86
g5
tp87
a(S'Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.'
p88
g5
tp89
a(S'This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.'
p90
g5
tp91
a(S"Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price"
p92
g2
tp93
a(S'Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping'
p94
g8
tp95
a(S'Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.'
p96
g5
tp97
a(S'This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.'
p98
g2
tp99
a(S'Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.'
p100
g2
tp101
a(S'The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.'
p102
g2
tp103
a(S'It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.'
p104
g5
tp105
a(S'The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.'
p106
g2
tp107
a(S'I used this router to plow out 3" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.'
p108
g5
tp109
a(S'This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.'
p110
g2
tp111
a(S'The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.'
p112
g5
tp113
a(S'The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.'
p114
g2
tp115
a(S'The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.'
p116
g8
tp117
a(S'I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.'
p118
g5
tp119
a(S'The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.'
p120
g8
tp121
a(S"However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it."
p122
g5
tp123
a(S"This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine."
p124
g2
tp125
a(S'Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.'
p126
g2
tp127
a(S'I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.'
p128
g5
tp129
a(S"The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site."
p130
g5
tp131
a(S'I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.'
p132
g2
tp133
a(S'The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.'
p134
g2
tp135
a(S'The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.'
p136
g2
tp137
a(S'The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.'
p138
g2
tp139
a(S'It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.'
p140
g2
tp141
a(S'Those are the good points.'
p142
g5
tp143
a(S'There are a few points of contention which I have.'
p144
g5
tp145
a(S'The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn\'t use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.'
p146
g5
tp147
a(S"The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so."
p148
g8
tp149
a(S'This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.'
p150
g5
tp151
a(S'The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.'
p152
g8
tp153
a(S"Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance."
p154
g8
tp155
a(S'I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.'
p156
g5
tp157
a(S'Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.'
p158
g2
tp159
a(S'This is an excellent router for the money.'
p160
g2
tp161
a(S'I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.'
p162
g5
tp163
a(S'The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.'
p164
g8
tp165
a(S'I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.'
p166
g8
tp167
a(S'Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.'
p168
g2
tp169
a(S'I must have gotten a good one.'
p170
g2
tp171
a(S'I don\'t have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven\'t tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .'
p172
g2
tp173
a(S'Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.'
p174
g5
tp175
a(S'I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.'
p176
g5
tp177
a(S'I have many others in the past.'
p178
g5
tp179
a(S'I would put the Hitachi up with the best!'
p180
g2
tp181
a(S'No vibration!'
p182
g2
tp183
a(S'Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.'
p184
g2
tp185
a(S'It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.'
p186
g2
tp187
a(S'Why do people spend all that money on accessories to "raise and lower " the router in a table??? A waste of money.'
p188
g5
tp189
a(S'It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.'
p190
g2
tp191
a(S'Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.'
p192
g2
tp193
a(S'The soft start is nice.'
p194
g2
tp195
a(S"The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)"
p196
g2
tp197
a(S'The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !'
p198
g2
tp199
a(S'Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.'
p200
g2
tp201
a(S"I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!"
p202
g5
tp203
a(S"I think I'll go rout something..."
p204
g5
tp205
a(S'Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.'
p206
g5
tp207
a(S'I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.'
p208
g5
tp209
a(S'Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.'
p210
g5
tp211
a(S'Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.'
p212
g2
tp213
a(S'UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.'
p214
g2
tp215
a(S'Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.'
p216
g2
tp217
a(S'It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.'
p218
g2
tp219
a(S'I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).'
p220
g5
tp221
a(S'Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).'
p222
g5
tp223
a(S'LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:'
p224
g5
tp225
a(S'1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.'
p226
g8
tp227
a(S"Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars)."
p228
g8
tp229
a(S'I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.'
p230
g8
tp231
a(S'Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.'
p232
g8
tp233
a(S'2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.'
p234
g5
tp235
a(S'Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.'
p236
g5
tp237
a(S'I do woodworking as a serious hobby.'
p238
g5
tp239
a(S'For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.'
p240
g2
tp241
a(S'Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.'
p242
g2
tp243
a(S'My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.'
p244
g5
tp245
a(S"The owner had three routers - all M12's."
p246
g5
tp247
a(S'This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.'
p248
g5
tp249
a(S'In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.'
p250
g5
tp251
a(S'After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.'
p252
g2
tp253
a(S'On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.'
p254
g2
tp255
a(S'I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.'
p256
g2
tp257
a(S'The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.'
p258
g8
tp259
a(S'Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.'
p260
g5
tp261
a(S"If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers.."
p262
g8
tp263
a(S'This router appeared in my wife\'s gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.'
p264
g5
tp265
a(S'She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.'
p266
g5
tp267
a(S'What an upgrade!!!'
p268
g2
tp269
a(S'I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.'
p270
g2
tp271
a(S'The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.'
p272
g2
tp273
a(S'The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.'
p274
g2
tp275
a(S"Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy."
p276
g2
tp277
a(S"I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!"
p278
g2
tp279
a(S'Now I need to get some 1/2" bits...'
p280
g5
tp281
a(S'I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.'
p282
g2
tp283
a(S"I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut."
p284
g2
tp285
a(S"It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break."
p286
g2
tp287
a(S"Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos."
p288
g2
tp289
a(S'I prefer things that are simple.'
p290
g2
tp291
a(S"I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work."
p292
g5
tp293
a(S'I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.'
p294
g5
tp295
a(S'The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.'
p296
g2
tp297
a(S'I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.'
p298
g8
tp299
a(S'It will take 31/2 inchers now.'
p300
g5
tp301
a(S'I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.'
p302
g8
tp303
a(S'I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.'
p304
g8
tp305
a(S'I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.'
p306
g8
tp307
a(S'Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.'
p308
g2
tp309
a(S"I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one."
p310
g5
tp311
a(S"I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it."
p312
g2
tp313
a(S'It is quiet and has plenty of power.'
p314
g2
tp315
a(S"I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability."
p316
g2
tp317
a(S'That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.'
p318
g8
tp319
a(S'Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.'
p320
g8
tp321
a(S'After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.'
p322
g8
tp323
a(S'I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.'
p324
g8
tp325
a(S"If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router."
p326
g5
tp327
a(S'If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.'
p328
g8
tp329
a(S'I love the performance and features of this router.'
p330
g2
tp331
a(S"For the money, I'm not sure you can do better."
p332
g2
tp333
a(S"It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great."
p334
g2
tp335
a(S'I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.'
p336
g5
tp337
a(S"I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well."
p338
g5
tp339
a(S'Smooth plunging mechanism.'
p340
g2
tp341
a(S'The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.'
p342
g2
tp343
a(S"The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits."
p344
g5
tp345
a(S"It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up."
p346
g8
tp347
a(S'Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.'
p348
g2
tp349
a(S'I purchased two of these beauties.'
p350
g2
tp351
a(S'For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.'
p352
g5
tp353
a(S'I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.'
p354
g2
tp355
a(S'One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.'
p356
g2
tp357
a(S'My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.'
p358
g5
tp359
a(S'The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.'
p360
g2
tp361
a(S'I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.'
p362
g5
tp363
a(S'They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.'
p364
g2
tp365
a(S'I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.'
p366
g2
tp367
a(S"The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole."
p368
g2
tp369
a(S'I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.'
p370
g5
tp371
a(S'As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.'
p372
g5
tp373
a(S'I would however highly recommend the m12v router !'
p374

g5
tp439

p440
g8
tp441
a(S'The depth adjustment was sloppy.'
p442

p450
g2
tp451
a(S'It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)'
p452
g5
tp453
a(S'I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.'
p454

p460
g5
tp461
a(S'Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.'
p462
g5

a(S'The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.'
p470
g8
tp471
a(S'I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!'
p472
g2
tp473

p474
g5
tp475

p484
g5
tp485

p496
g2
tp497
a(S"I couldn't believe what I had been missing."
p498
g2
tp499
a(S"If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget."

g2
tp501

g2
tp509

p510
g2
tp511
a(S"The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well."
p512
g8
tp513
a(S'I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.'
p514
g8
tp515

p524
g2
tp525
a(S'I really liked the price...'
p526
g2
tp527
a(S'I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.'
p528
g5
tp529
a(S"It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router."
p530
g5
tp531
a(S'Because of this I have removed the handles.'
p532
g5
tp533
a(S'I like the speed control.'
p534
g2
tp535
a(S'It works well with the larger bits.'
p536
g5
tp537
a(S'(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).'
p538
g5
tp539
a(S'It has plenty of power.'
p540
g2
tp541
a(S'The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.'
p542
g8
tp543
a(S'Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.'
p544
g8
tp545
a(S"After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy."
p546
g5
tp547
a(S'The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.'
p548
g5
tp549
a(S'I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.'
p550
g8
tp551
a(S'All in all I am pleased with the router.'
p552
g2
tp553
a(S'The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.'

g2
tp555
a(S'I have owned this router for nearly five years.'
p556
g5
tp557
a(S'Until recently it was my only router.'
p558
g5
tp559
a(S'Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.'
p560
g5
tp561
a(S'It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.'
p562
g8
tp563
a(S'Recenly the variable speed control went out.'
p564
g8
tp565
a(S'It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.'
p566
g8
tp567
a(S"The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service."
p568
g5
tp569
a(S'I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.'
p570
g5
tp571
a(S"I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal."
p572
g5
tp573

p574
g8
tp575
a(S'Overall it is a great value.'
p576
g2
tp577
a(S"For the price I don't think you can beat it."

p580
g2

g8
tp591
a(S'First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.'
p592
g5
tp593
a(S'Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.'
p594
g5
tp595
a(S'I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.'
p596
g5
tp597
a(S'When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.'
p598
g2
tp599
a(S'But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.'
p600
g5
tp601
a(S'Then, without warning, it took off again.'
p602
g5
tp603
a(S'Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.'
p604
g8
tp605
a(S'I use these routers under a table.'

g5
tp607
a(S'Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.'
p608
g5
tp609
a(S'Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.'
p610
g8
tp611
a(S'You must keep double checking depths.'
p612
g8

a(S'But, for the money it is a good machine.'
p614
g2
tp615
a(S'Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.'
p616
g8
tp617
a(S"The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will."

a(S'I am now waiting for this one to stop.'
p620
g5
tp621
a(S"For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy."
