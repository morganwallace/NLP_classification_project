S"I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)"
p1
S'pos'
p2
sS'3- USB kicks!'
p3
S'neutral'
p4
sS'Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).'
p5
g2
sS'However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.'
p6
g4
sS"It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere."
p7
g2
sS'Hate to wait between shots'
p8
g2
sS'However, I do have a few things to complain about...'
p9
g4
sS'This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.'
p10
S'neg'
p11
sS"When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin."
p12
g11
sS"It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever."
p13
g2
sS'I put a 128MB CF card in it.'
p14
g4
sS'This is the only camera with all these capabilities.'
p15
g4
sS'The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.'
p16
g2
sS"In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results."
p17
g4
sS'It is hot enough to be annoying.'
p18
g11
sS'7- 360'
p19
g2
sS'I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.'
p20
g4
sS"I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system."
p21
g4
sS'Even with the waterproof housing it is small.'
p22
g2
sS"My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be."
p23
g11
sS'I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).'
p24
g2
sS'These are all the flaws I found in the camera,'
p25
g4
sS'The pictures are a little dark sometimes.'
p26
g11
sS'I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.'
p27
g2
sS"Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room."
p28
g4
sS'The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.'
p29
g4
sS'The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.'
p30
g2
sS"It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow."
p31
g2
sS'I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.'
p32
g4
sS'Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.'
p33
g11
sS"I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes."
p34
g11
sS'The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.'
p35
g2
sS'It fits in your pocket.'
p36
g2
sS'The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.'
p37
g11
sS'I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.'
p38
g4
sS'The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.'
p39
g11
sS'6- Small but very clear TFT screen.'
p40
g2
sS'I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...'
p41
g4
sS'But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.'
p42
g4
sS"Canon says it's normal."
p43
g4
sS'1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.'
p44
g4
sS"And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing."
p45
g4
sS'I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.'
p46
g2
sS'Take quick pictures with excelent resolution'
p47
g2
sS'But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.'
p48
g2
sS'The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).'
p49
g2
sS'My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.'
p50
g4
sS"This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR."
p51
g2
sS'I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!'
p52
g2
sS'The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.'
p53
g11
sS'This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:'
p54
g2
sS'The digital zoom is crap.'
p55
g11
sS'One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.'
p56
g4
sS"it's not my first choice in cameras,"
p57
g11
sS'A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).'
p58
g4
sS'Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.'
p59
g11
sS"The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration)."
p60
g2
sS'If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.'
p61
g4
sS'The price is $... more.'
p62
g11
sS'At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.'
p63
g2
sS" the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!"
p64
g11
sS"The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it."
p65
g11
sS'It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.'
p66
g2
sS'The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.'
p67
g4
sS'It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.'
p68
g2
sS'3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card'
p69
g11
sS'I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.'
p70
g4
sS'1) It is perhaps too small.'
p71
g11
sS'I said, can your fancy camera do that?'
p72
g4
sS"I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size."
p73
g2
sS'I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.'
p74
g2
sS'The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).'
p75
g2
sS'The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.'
p76
g2
sS'First off, the battery.'
p77
g11
sS'4- Looks great.'
p78
g2
sS"I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen."
p79
g2
sS'I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).'
p80
g4
sS'What else can I say?'
p81
g4
sS'I take my camera everywhere.'
p82
g4
sS"I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it."
p83
g2
sS"I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!"
p84
g2
sS'I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.'
p85
g4
sS'This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).'
p86
g2
sS"It's a little jewel."
p87
g4
sS'Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.'
p88
g4
sS'I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.'
p89
g4
sS'I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.'
p90
g4
sS'This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.'
p91
g2
sS'First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.'
p92
g2
sS'You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.'
p93
g4
sS"It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!)."
p94
g2
sS"This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine."
p95
g11
sS'I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.'
p96
g2
sS'The flash is very weak.'
p97
g11
sS'price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.'
p98
g4
sS'(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).'
p99
g4

g4
sS'Good quality and fun!'
p102
g4
sS"The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it."
p103
g2
sS'I wrote another review and this is the update.'
p104
g4
sS'The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.'
p105
g11
sS'The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.'
p106
g2
sS'This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!'
p107
g4
sS'Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:'
p108
g4
sS'5- Excelent software package.'
p109
g2
sS'But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.'
p110
g2
sS"I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it."
p111
g2
sS"The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint."
p112
g4
sS'The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.'
p113
g11
sS'End of story.'
p114
g4
sS'I love this camera.'
p115
g2
sS"This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting."

p120
g2
sS'I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).'
p121
g2
sS'The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.'
p122
g11
sS'I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.'
p123
g2
sS"The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap."
p124
g2
sS'My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.'
p125
g4

p128
g2
sS'I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.'
p129
g4
sS'If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.'
p130
g2
sS'I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.'
p131
g11
sS"While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture."
p132
g4

p136
g4
sS'It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.'
p137
g4
sS'Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.'

sS'I then realized a major design flaw.'
p144
g11
sS'This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.'

g4
sS'1- Small.'
p146
g2
sS"I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera."
p147
g4
sS'Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.'
p148
g11
sS'Turn it off.'
p149
g4
sS'The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).'
p150
g4
sS'But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.'
p151
g4
sS'On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.'
p152
g4
sS'A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")'

p158
g4

p159
g4
sS'2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.'
p160
g11
sS'The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.'
p161
g2
sS'High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.'

g4
sS'Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.'
p178
g2
sS"It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:"

p187
g11
sS"The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack."
p188
g2
sS'Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).'
p189
g11
sS'The LCD should be used.'
p190
g4
sS"it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable."
p191
g2
sS"This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240."
p192
g2
sS"I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country."
p193
g4
sS'OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.'
p194
