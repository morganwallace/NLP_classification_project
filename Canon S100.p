(S'I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.'
p1
S'pos'
p2
tp3
a(S"Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras."
p4
S'neutral'
p5
tp6
a(S"I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen."
p7
g2
tp8
a(S"The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it."
p9
S'neg'
p10
tp11
a(S"I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while."
p12
g10
tp13
a(S'A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.'
p14
g10
tp15
a(S"Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,"
p16
g10
tp17
a(S"I'd say that this camera is perfect."
p18
g2
tp19
a(S'OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.'
p20
g2
tp21
a(S"I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size."
p22
g2
tp23
a(S"It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera."
p24
g2
tp25
a(S'I take it with me everywhere,literally,'
p26
g5
tp27
a(S"it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable."
p28
g2
tp29
a(S'There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.'
p30
g2
tp31
a(S'The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!'
p32
g2
tp33
a(S"The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration)."
p34
g2
tp35
a(S'However, I do have a few things to complain about...'
p36
g5
tp37
a(S'First off, the battery.'
p38
g10
tp39
a(S'This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.'
p40
g10
tp41
a(S'Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.'
p42
g10
tp43
a(S"The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes."
p44
g5
tp45
a(S"This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine."
p46
g10
tp47
a(S'Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.'
p48
g10
tp49
a(S'Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!'
p50
g10
tp51
a(S'Very wrong.'
p52
g5
tp53
a(S'The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.'
p54
g10
tp55
a(S'Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.'
p56
g10
tp57
a(S'The flash is very weak.'
p58
g10
tp59
a(S"Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room."
p60
g5
tp61
a(S'The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.'
p62
g10
tp63
a(S'The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.'
p64
g10
tp65
a(S'To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.'
p66
g10
tp67
a(S'The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.'
p68
g2
tp69
a(S'These are all the flaws I found in the camera,'
p70
g5
tp71
a(S"it's not my first choice in cameras,"
p72
g10
tp73
a(S'I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.'
p74
g2
tp75
a(S'If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.'
p76
g2
tp77
a(S'I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...'
p78
g5
tp79
a(S'after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.'
p80
g2
tp81
a(S'I have had this little gem for four months now.'
p82
g5
tp83
a(S'It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.'
p84
g2
tp85
a(S'I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.'
p86
g5
tp87
a(S'I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.'
p88
g5
tp89
a(S"I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted."
p90
g5
tp91
a(S'1) It is perhaps too small.'
p92
g10
tp93
a(S'I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.'
p94
g10
tp95
a(S'Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).'
p96
g10
tp97
a(S'2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.'
p98
g10
tp99
a(S'This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.'
p100
g10
tp101
a(S'3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card'
p102
g10
tp103
a(S'(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).'
p104
g5
tp105
a(S'4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.'
p106
g10
tp107
a(S'It is hot enough to be annoying.'
p108
g10
tp109
a(S"Canon says it's normal."
p110
g5
tp111
a(S'I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.'
p112
g5
tp113
a(S'This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).'
p114
g2
tp115
a(S"It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots."
p116
g2
tp117
a(S'I have used many digital cameras.'
p118
g5
tp119
a(S'This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:'

g2
tp121
a(S'Take quick pictures with excelent resolution'
p122
g2
tp123
a(S'Hate to wait between shots'

p130
g2
tp131
a(S"FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD"
p132
g2
tp133
a(S"The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera."
p134
g2
tp135
a(S'I love this camera.'
p136
g2
tp137
a(S"I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it."
p138
g2
tp139
a(S"It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever."
p140
g2
tp141
a(S'I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.'
p142
g5
tp143
a(S'I am very pleased with my purchase.'
p144
g2
tp145
a(S"It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:"
p146
g5
tp147
a(S"I've been incredibly happy with this camera."
p148
g2
tp149
a(S"This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR."
p150
g2
tp151
a(S"It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow."
p152
g2
tp153
a(S'Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).'
p154
g2
tp155
a(S'Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.'
p156
g2
tp157
a(S"The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint."
p158
g5
tp159
a(S'The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.'
p160
g2
tp161
a(S"It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!)."
p162
g2
tp163
a(S'A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")'
p164
g5
tp165
a(S'I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !'
p166
g10
tp167
a(S'I then realized a major design flaw.'
p168
g10
tp169
a(S"All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional."
p170
g10
tp171
a(S"When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !"
p172
g10
tp173
a(S'I wrote another review and this is the update.'
p174
g5
tp175
a(S'I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).'
p176
g2
tp177
a(S'I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.'
p178
g5

a(S'I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.'
p180
g5
tp181
a(S'Here are some useful facts:-'
p182
g5
tp183
a(S'On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.'
p184
g5
tp185
a(S'A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).'
p186
g5
tp187
a(S'The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.'
p188
g10
tp189
a(S'The LCD should be used.'
p190
g5
tp191
a(S'However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.'
p192
g5
tp193
a(S'The digital zoom is crap.'
p194
g10
tp195
a(S'Turn it off.'
p196
g5
tp197
a(S'It fits in your pocket.'
p198
g2
tp199
a(S'The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).'
p200
g5
tp201
a(S'But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.'
p202
g5
tp203
a(S'I take my camera everywhere.'
p204
g5
tp205
a(S'Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.'
p206
g5
tp207

p208
g5
tp209
a(S'The panorama setting is unbelieveable !'

g2
tp211
a(S'You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !'
p212
g5
tp213
a(S'The pictures are a little dark sometimes.'
p214
g10
tp215
a(S'You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.'
p216

p220
g10
tp221
a(S'It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.'
p222
g2
tp223
a(S'The price is $... more.'
p224
g10
tp225
a(S'I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP'
p226
g10
tp227
a(S'I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.'
p228
g5
tp229
a(S"The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software."
p230
g10
tp231
a(S'The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.'
p232
g10
tp233
a(S'But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.'
p234
g2
tp235

a(S'I would recommend this camera unequivocally!'
p246
g2
tp247
a(S'My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.'
p248
g5
tp249
a(S'The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.'
p250
g5
tp251
a(S'The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.'
p252
g5
tp253
a(S'But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.'
p254

tp255
a(S"I've been using this camera for a few months now."
p256
g5
tp257

p266
g5
tp267

p268
g2
tp269
a(S'My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.'
p270
g5
tp271
a(S'But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.'

p284

p286
g10
tp287
a(S"I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!"
p288
g10
tp289
a(S'Other than that, I love this camera.'
p290
g2
tp291
a(S'The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.'
p292
g2
tp293
a(S'The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.'
p294
g2
tp295
a(S'If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.'
p296
g2
tp297
a(S"The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack."

p308
g5
tp309
a(S'End of story.'
p310
g5
tp311
a(S"I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it."
p312
g2
tp313
a(S'I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.'
p314
g2
tp315
a(S'I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.'

tp337
a(S'The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.'
p338
g2
tp339
a(S'If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.'
p340
g5
tp341
a(S'All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.'
p342
g10

p350
g5
tp351
a(S'Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.'
p352
g10
tp353
a(S'I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.'
p354
g10
tp355

g5
tp367
a(S"I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!"
