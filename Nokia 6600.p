p126
g10

p140
g5
tp141
a(S"I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone."

p230
g2
tp231
a(S'The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.'
p232
g5
tp233
a(S'4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.'
p234
g2
tp235

p248
g5
tp249
a(S"I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine."

p270
g2
tp271
a(S'No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.'
p272
g5
tp273
a(S'On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.'

a(S"I've had no problems w/ this phone."
p286
g2
tp287
a(S"STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing."
p288
g5
tp289
a(S"As for appearance, well, that's subjective."
p290

p316
g10
tp317
a(S"The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850)."

g10
tp395
a(S'Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.'
p396
g10
tp397
a(S'This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.'
p398
g10
tp399
a(S'Does all this sound technical?'
p400
g10
tp401
a(S"That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech."
p402
g10
tp403
a(S'Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!'
p404
g5
tp405
a(S'So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.'
p406
g10
tp407
a(S'He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.'
p408
g10
tp409
a(S'I followed the technician\'s directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."'
p410
g10
tp411
a(S'I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.'
p412
g10
tp413
a(S'I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.'
p414
g10
tp415
a(S"Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!"
p416
g10
tp417
a(S'After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.'
p418
g10
tp419
a(S'I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.'
p420
g10
tp421
a(S'All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.'
p422
g10
tp423
a(S'I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.'
p424
g10
tp425
a(S'Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.'
p426
g10
tp427
a(S'Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.'
p428
g10
tp429
a(S'I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.'
p430
g10
tp431
a(S'They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.'
p432
g10
tp433
a(S"I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30."
p434
g10
tp435
a(S'This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.'
p436
g5
tp437
a(S'The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.'
p438
g10
tp439
a(S"In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly."
p440
g5
tp441
a(S'You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.'
p442
g10

p450
g2
tp451
a(S'It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.'
p452
g2
tp453
a(S"I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone."
p454
g2
tp455
a(S"It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow."
p456
g5
tp457
a(S'You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.'
p458
g5
tp459
a(S'Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.'
p460
g10
tp461
a(S"Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go."
p462
g5
tp463
a(S"The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well."
p464
g5
tp465
a(S'The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.'
p466
g2
tp467
a(S"The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will."
p468
g2
tp469
a(S'All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.'
p470
g10

p482
g5

p486
g10

tp515
a(S'1) phone card calling feature.'
p516
g10
tp517
a(S"This phone doesn't include Phone card calling."
p518
g5
tp519
a(S'So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.'
p520
g10
tp521
a(S'This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.'
p522
g5
tp523
a(S'For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.'
p524
g10
tp525
a(S'All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.'
p526
g10
tp527
a(S'This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.'
p528
g10
tp529
a(S'My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.'
p530
g5
tp531
a(S'All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".'
p532
g10
tp533
a(S'2) Low volume on regular answering.'
p534
g10
tp535
a(S"In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece."
p536
g5
tp537
a(S'You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.'
p538
g10
tp539
a(S'Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.'
p540
g5
tp541
a(S'Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......'
p542
g10
tp543
a(S'My explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....'
p544
g10
tp545
a(S'the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....'
p546
g10
tp547
a(S'So no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .'
p548
g10
tp549
a(S'I have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .'
p550
g10
tp551
a(S'Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .'
p552
g5
tp553
a(S"1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet ."
p554
g5
tp555
a(S'2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .'
p556
g5
tp557
a(S"3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias ."
p558
g5
tp559
a(S'As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.'
p560
g10
tp561
a(S'A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .'
p562
g10
tp563
a(S'4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you\'ll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don\'t expect to get much done .'
p564
g5
tp565
a(S"5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol ."
p566
g10
tp567
a(S"Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average ."
p568
g5
tp569
a(S"I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone ."
p570
g5
tp571
a(S"I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one ."
p572
g5
tp573

p574
g10
tp575
a(S'I never had a single problem.'

p582
g2
tp583
a(S'Bottom line great phone for the time being.'
p584
g2
tp585
a(S'I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.'
p586
g2
tp587
a(S'Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.'
p588
g2
tp589
a(S'So, do I recommend the 6600?'
p590
g10
tp591
a(S'Yes, certainly.'
p592
g10
tp593
a(S"But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine."
p594
g10
tp595
a(S'The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.'
p596
g2
tp597
a(S'The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.'
p598
g2
tp599
a(S'Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.'
p600
g5
tp601
a(S'In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.'
p602
g2
tp603
a(S"I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone."

a(S"Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used."
p620
g2
tp621

p622
g2
tp623
a(S"Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone."

g2
tp635
a(S'I think the interface is great.'
p636
g2
tp637
a(S'I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).'
p638

p640
g10
tp641
a(S"I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc."

p662
g10
tp663
a(S"I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it."

p680
g10
tp681
a(S'With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.'

g10
tp953
a(S'I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.'
p954
g2
tp955
a(S'The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.'
p956
g10
tp957
a(S"The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins."

g2
tp965
a(S'This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.'
p966
g2
tp967
a(S'The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.'
p968
g5
tp969
a(S"Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it."
p970
g2
tp971
a(S'Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.'
p972
g10

p1012
g5
tp1013
a(S'So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.'
p1014
g10
tp1015
a(S'The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".'
