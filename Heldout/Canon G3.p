sS"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras ."

sS"you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product ."

g2
sS'in general it is easy to use and well laid out .'
p10
g4
sS'a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .'
p11
g2
sS'i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .'
p12
g2
sS'why ?'
p13
g2
sS'once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .'
p14
g2
sS'canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .'
p15
g2
sS'( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .'

p19
g2
sS'a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .'
p20
g4
sS'this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .'
p21
g4
sS'it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .'
p22
g6
sS'yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .'
p23
g2
sS'because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .'
p24
g2
sS'the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .'
p25
g4
sS"although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of ."
p26
g2
sS"some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect )."
p27
g2
sS'but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .'
p28
g2
sS'it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .'
p29
g2
sS'i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !'

sS'everything else about the camera is great .'
p31
g4
sS'the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .'

sS"i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash ."

p35
g2
sS'after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .'

sS'i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .'
p37

sS'( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )'
p39
g2
sS"i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected ."

sS']major design flaw'
p48
g2
sS"i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind ."
p49
g4
sS"the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features ."
p50
g4
sS"i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera ."
p51
g2
sS"i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !"
p52
g4
sS'the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .'
p53
g4
sS'i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .'
p54
g4
sS"i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first ."
p55
g2
sS'my story is based on personal usage .'
p56
g2
sS'i love this camera .'
p57
g4
sS'the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .'
p58
g6
sS'overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .'
p59
g4
sS'this is my first digital camera .'
p60
g2
sS'i am not talking milliseconds .'
p61

sS'they stop time .'
p62
g2
sS'this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .'
p63
g2
sS"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy ."
p64
g6
sS"]you 'll take more pics"
p65
g2
sS'this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .'
p66
g4
sS'it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .'
p67
g4
sS'it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .'
p68
g2
sS'newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .'
p69
g4
sS"i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly ."
p70
g2
sS'i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .'
p71
g2
sS'canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .'
p72
g4
sS'one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n\'t ship on saturdays " .'
p73
g2
sS'yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .'
p74
g2
sS'1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .'
p75
g6
sS'i give it 10 stars !'
p76
g2
sS'the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .'
p77
g2
sS"its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen ."
p78
g4
sS"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )"
p79
g4
sS'then again a one time use camera may do just as well .'
p80
g2
sS'- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .'
p81
g2
sS']great digital camera'
p82
g2
sS'i love the quality of the pictures .'
p83
g4
sS'short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .'
p84
g2
sS'sure .'
p85
g2
sS'this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .'
p86
g4
sS'i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .'
p87
g2
sS'hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .'
p88
g2
sS"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings ."
p89
g4
sS'the camera was a marvel .'
p90
g4
sS'this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .'
p91
g4
sS'maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .'
p92
g6
sS']within its limitations'
p93
g2
sS'the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .'
p94
g2
sS'recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .'
p95
g4
sS']great camera'
p96
g2
sS'5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .'
p97
g4
sS']fantastic digital camera'
p98
g2
sS'highly recommended .'
p99
g2
sS'so buy the g3 .'
p100
g2
sS'then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .'
p101
g2
sS'i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .'
p102
g2
sS'getting the printer to help output them was another tale .'
p103
g2
sS'however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .'
p104
g4
sS'2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .'
p105
g4
sS'having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .'
p106
g4
sS'some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .'
p107
g2
sS"do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype ."
p108
g2
sS'for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .'
p109
g2
sS"overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do ."
p110
g2
sS'i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .'
p111
g4
sS'in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .'
p112
g2
sS'it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .'

sS']canon g3 review / response / recommendation'

g2
sS"unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it ."
p115
g2
sS'the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .'
p116
g2
sS'however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .'
p117
g2
sS'2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .'
p118
g6
sS'one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .'
p119
g6
sS']great gadget'
p120
g2
sS'it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .'
p121
g6
sS"i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital ."
p122
g2
sS"for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor ."
p123
g2
sS'the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .'
p124

sS'beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .'
p125

sS'a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .'
p126

sS'i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .'
p127
g2
sS'the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .'
p128
g4
sS'it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .'
p129
g2
sS'if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .'
p130
g2
sS'before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :'
p131
g2
sS'6 . the g2 \'s " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .'
p132
g2
sS'advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .'
p133

sS'it is made of plastic .'
p134

sS'a big plus in my book .'
p136
g2
sS']love it more and more'

g2
sS'the more i work with it , the more i love it !'
p138
g4
sS']cool toy'
p139
g2
sS'i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .'
p140
g4
sS'i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?'
p141
g2
sS'the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .'
p142
g4
sS'this is not a handbag camera .'
p143
g2
sS'it is a very amazing product .'
p144
g4
sS'it is not perfect though .'
p145
g2
sS'next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .'
p146
g2
sS'the grain was terrible .'
p147
g6
sS'still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .'
p148
g2
sS"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome ."
p149
g4
sS'if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .'
p150
g2
sS'but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .'
p151
g4
sS'great colors , pictures and white balance .'
p152
g4
sS'* main dial is not backlit .'
p153
g6
sS'this camera has a major design flaw .'
p154
g6
sS'as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .'
p155
g2
sS"the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen ."
p156
g4
sS'i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !'
p157
g2
sS"this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier ."
p158
g4
sS'there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .'
p159
g2
sS"i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) ."
p160
g2
sS'the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .'

sS"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy ."

p164

sS"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task ."
p165
g6
sS'what task do they perform ?'
p166
g2
sS'at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .'

p171
g2
sS"these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives ."
p172

sS"another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen ."
p173
g4
sS'if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .'

sS"or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it ."

p182

p183
g2
sS'after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .'
p184

sS'i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .'
p185
g2
sS'* lens visible in optical viewfinder .'
p186

p191
g4
sS'anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .'
p192
g2
sS'good points :'
p193
g2
sS'and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .'
p194
g2
sS'3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .'
p195
g4
sS'you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .'
p196
g4
sS'this camera performs like i can not believe !'
p197
g2
sS'the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .'
p198
g2
sS'with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .'
p199
g4
sS'and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .'
p200
g2
sS"but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :"
p201
g2
sS"i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) ."
p202
g4
sS'it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .'
p203
g4
sS']outstanding camera'
p204
g2
sS'all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .'
p205
g4
sS'i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .'
p206
g2
sS'i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !'
p207
g4
sS'i bought this last week through amazon .'
p208
g2
sS'following my research , i decided on the g3 .'
p209
g2
sS'maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .'
p210
g2
sS'for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .'
p211
g2
sS'+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .'
p212
g2
sS'and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .'
p213
g2
sS'the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .'
p214
g2
sS'flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .'
p215
g6
sS'i chose the canon speedlite 420 .'
p216
g2
sS'i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .'
p217
g2
sS'you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .'
p218
g2
sS'the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .'
p219
g4
sS']excellent picture quality / color'
p220
g2
sS'poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .'
p221
g2
sS"i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like ."
p222

sS'messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .'

g4
sS']canon g3 ? incredible camera'
p228
g2
sS'the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .'
p229
g6
sS"this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get ."
p230
g4
sS'i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .'
p231
g2
sS'the image quality is excellent .'
p232
g4
sS'i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .'
p233
g2
sS"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )"
p234
g6
sS'even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .'
p235
g4
sS'like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .'
p236
g2
sS'the prints are beautiful !'
p237
g4
sS'proven canon built quality and lens .'
p238
g4
sS"my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com ."
p239

sS'simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .'
p240
g4
sS'the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .'
p241
g4
sS']powerful product'
p242
g2
sS"my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera ."
p243
g2
sS'the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :'
p244
g4
sS"i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything ."
p245
g4
sS'in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .'
p246
g2
sS'the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .'
p247
g6
sS']excellent camera'
p248
g2
sS"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance ."
p249
g4
sS'you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .'
p250
g2
sS'that meant even less light and just as much action .'
p251
g2
sS"it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen ."
p252
g4
sS'now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !'
p253
g6
sS']great camera but g2 will do the same for less'
p254
g2
sS'this is quite simply the best you can ask for .'
p255
g4
sS"i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens ."
p256
g2
sS'took hundreds of pictures and they were great .'
p257
g4
sS'when it arrives , you press the shutter release .'
p258
g2
sS'so why lie about it ?'
p259
g2
sS'you can always spend more money to get a better one .'
p260
g2
sS'9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .'
p261
g2
sS'5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .'
p262
g2
sS"i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;"
p263
g4
sS'am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !'
p264
g4
sS'it focuses in a snap .'
p265
g2
sS'i cancelled the order .'
p266
g2
sS'however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .'
p267
g2
sS'however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .'
p268
g2
sS'it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .'
p269
g2
sS'you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .'
p270
g2
sS'negative points :'
p271
g2
sS'save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .'
p272
g2
sS'this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .'
p273
g2
sS'the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .'
p274
g6
sS'just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .'
p275
g4
sS'her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .'
p276
g2
sS'warning - i did read the manual !'
p277
g2
sS'the camera has a wonderful set of features .'
p278
g4
sS'a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .'
p279
g2
sS"go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense ."
p280
g2
sS'my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .'
p281
g2
sS'the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .'
p282
g4
sS']the best of everything'
p283
g2
sS'i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !'
p284
g2
sS'in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !'
p285
g4
sS'it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it \'s finer features , i \'d suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .'
p286
g2
sS'4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .'
p287
g4
sS']canon never ceases to amaze'
p288
g2
sS"this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this ."
p289
g2
sS'i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .'
p290
g2
sS'See Readme.txt to find the meaning of each symbol.'
p291
g2
sS'they look fantastic .'
p292
g4
sS'bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .'
p293
g4
sS']upgraded from g2 and not looking back'
p294
g2
sS"the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood ."
p295
g4
sS"you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost ."
p296
g2
sS'the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .'
p297
g6
sS'got a great deal from a reputable seller .'
p298
g2
sS'for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .'
p299
g2
sS"they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's ."
p300
g2
sS"if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there ."
p301
g2
sS'4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .'
p302
g4
sS"( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )"
p303
g2
sS"being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 ."
p304
g2
sS'for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .'
p305
g2
sS'contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .'
p306
g4
sS"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision ."
p307
g4
sS'if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .'
p308
g2
sS'i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .'
p309
g2
sS"there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize ."
p310
g2
sS'the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .'
p311
g4
sS'in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .'
p312
g2
sS'i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .'
p313
g4
sS"the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you ."
p314
g2
sS'i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .'
p315
g2
sS'the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .'
p316
g2
sS'it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .'
p317
g4
sS'best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .'
p318
g4
sS"i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected ."
p319
g2
sS'i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .'
p320
g2
sS'what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .'
p321
g2
sS"that 's what i did and hopes this helps ."
p322
g2
sS'thanks for nothing , amazon !'
p323
g2
sS"a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more ."
p324
g2
sS"and so far , i 've been very pleased ."
p325
g4
sS"although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it ."
p326
g2
sS'i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .'
p327
g4
sS'it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .'
p328
g6
sS"do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed ."
p329
g2
sS'added 2-24 .'
p330
g2
sS'the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .'
p331
g2
sS'it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !'
p332
g4
sS'from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .'
p333
g2
sS'4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .'
p334
g2
sS'very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .'
p335
g4

p339
g2
sS'i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .'
p340
g2
sS'i love the eos based controls and easy menus .'
p341

p342
g2
sS'cameras capture moments .'
p343
g2
sS"in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking ."
p344
g2
sS'the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .'
p345
g4
sS'big mistake .'
p346
g2
sS'learning how to use it will not take very long .'
p347
g4
sS'by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .'
p348
g4
sS"they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet ."
p349
g2
sS'if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .'
p350
g2
sS'though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .'
p351
g2
sS'at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .'
p352
g2
sS'the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .'
p353
g6
sS'i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .'
p354
g2
sS'i highly recommend it .'
p355
g4
sS']i love it more the longer i own it'
p356
g2
sS"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets ."
p357
g4
sS'( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .'
p358
g6
sS"first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's ."
p359
g4
sS'but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .'
p360
g2
sS'i just bought the camera a few days ago .'
p361
g2
sS"]best camera i 've used"
p362
g2
sS'has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .'

g4
sS'battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .'
p365
g4
sS'relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .'
p366
g6
sS'the g2 was better in this respect .'
p367
g2
sS'so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .'
p368
g2
sS'it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?'
p369
g6
sS'unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .'
p370
g2
sS"+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use ."

p372
g2
sS"i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers ."
p373
g4
sS"i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too ."
p374
g2
sS'this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .'
p375
g2
sS'well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .'
p376
g6
sS"with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet ."
p377

p381
g2
sS"i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera ."
p382

sS'we also looked at the fuji fps602 .'
p383
g2
sS'i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .'
p384
g2
sS'great job canon !'
p385
g2
sS'the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .'
p386
g6
sS'after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .'
p387
g2
sS'definetely a great camera .'
p388
g4
sS'excellent range of metering options as well .'
p389
g4
sS'those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .'
p390
g4
sS'i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .'
p391
g2
sS'i am quite happy with the camera .'
p392
g4
sS'make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !'
p393
g2
sS'when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .'
p394
g6
sS'but who cares ?'
p395
g2
sS']the pictures are brillient'
p396
g2
sS'sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .'

p403

sS"i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok ."
p404
g2
sS"i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged ."
p405
g2
sS'it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .'
p406

sS"in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode ."
p427
g4
sS'i agree with the positive reviews .'

sS'i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .'

sS'range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .'
p430
g4
sS'in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .'

sS"there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures ."
p432
g2
sS'i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .'
p433
g2
sS'you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .'
p434

g2
sS'the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .'
p436
g2
sS']pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship'
p437
g2
sS'the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .'
p438
g4
sS"i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !"
p439

p448
g4
sS"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price ."
p449
g4
sS'and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .'
p450
g2
sS'i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .'
p451
g2
sS'a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .'
p452
g2
sS"there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation ."

g4
sS'me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .'
p455
g2
sS'the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .'
p456
g4
sS'this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !'
p457
g4
sS'4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .'
p458
g4
sS'i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .'

sS'but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .'
p474
g2
sS'got way too many blurry pictures .'
p475
g6
sS'many before me have done that already .'
p476
g2
sS'overall it is the best camera on the market .'
p477
g4
sS'2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )'
p478
g4
sS'unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .'
p479
g2
sS'perhaps there is a way around this delay .'
p480
g2
sS'the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .'
p481
g4
sS'in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .'
p482
g2
sS"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !"
p483
g4
sS'what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .'
p484
g4
sS']beware'
p485
g2
sS'what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .'
p486
g4
sS'it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .'
p487
g6
sS'the light auto-correction is awesome .'
p488
g4
sS'with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .'
p489
g4
sS'here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :'
p490
g2
sS'i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .'
p491
g2
sS"i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this ."
p492
g2
sS'positives'
p493
g2
sS'rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .'
p494
g2
sS'some of the great gains over g2 --'
p495
g2
sS'any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .'
p496
g2
sS'unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .'
p497
g2
sS'your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .'
p498
g2
sS"fiance did n't like the feel ."
p499
g2
sS'i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !'
p500
g4
sS'the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .'
p501
g2
sS'i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .'
p502
g2
sS'but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !'
p503
g4
sS'the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .'
p504
g6
sS'i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .'
p505
g2
sS"i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control ."
p506
g2
sS"the nikon 's are great cameras ."
p507
g2
sS'and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .'
p508
g6
sS'what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .'
p509
g6
sS'4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .'
p510
g6
sS'buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .'
p511
g2
sS'not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .'
p512
g2
sS'and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .'
p513
g2
sS"i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised ."
p514
g4
sS'takes excellent photos .'
p515
g4
sS'i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .'
p516
g4
sS'about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .'
p517
g6
sS'one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .'
p518
g6
sS'the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .'
p519
g4
sS'dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .'
p520
g2
sS'i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .'
p521
g2
sS'picture this :'
p522
g2
sS'as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .'
p523
g2
sS"my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again ."
p524
g2
sS"i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual ."
p525
g2
sS'it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .'
p526
g2
sS'as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .'
p527
g2
sS'this camera will stay with me for years !'
p528
g2
sS'very easy to use .'
p529
g2
sS'after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .'
p530
g2
sS'because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !'
p531
g4
sS'duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .'
p532
g2
sS"i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time ."
p533
g2
sS'the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .'
p534
g6
sS'it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..'
p535
g4
sS'( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .'
p536
g2
sS'yep .'
p537
g2
sS"i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery ."
p538
g2
sS'i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .'
p539
g2
sS'the distortion is not a flaw .'
p540
g2
sS'for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .'
p541
g2
sS'1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .'
p542
g4
sS']best of the best'
p543
g2
sS'not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .'
p544
g2
sS'because this camera is beautiful .'
p545
g4
sS"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon ."
p546
g4
sS'the powershot g3 is a great camera .'
p547
g4
sS'the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .'
p548
g6
sS'i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .'
p549
g2
sS"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )"
p550
g6
sS"the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try ."
p551
g2
sS'Product name: Canon G3'
p552
g2
sS']this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam'
p553
g2
sS'unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .'
p554
g6
sS'to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .'
p555
g6
sS'splash !'
p556
g2
sS'i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .'
p557
g2
sS'needless to say , the canon won , hands down .'
p558
g2
sS"nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again ."
p559
g2
sS'based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .'
p560
g2
sS'what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?'
p561
g2
sS"looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive ."
p562
g2
sS'it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .'
p563
g4
sS"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !"
p564
g4
sS"as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever ."
p565
g2
sS'i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .'
p566
g2
sS'i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :'
p567
g2
sS'and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .'
p568
g2
sS"this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure ."
p569
g2
sS'the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .'
p570
g2
sS'excellent idea !'
p571
g2
sS'moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .'
p572
g2
sS"i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera ."
p573
g2
sS'i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .'
p574
g2
sS'fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .'
p575
g4
sS'negatives'
p576
g2
sS'the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .'
p577
g4
sS'this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .'
p578
g2
sS'the service from the supplier was exceptional .'
p579
g4
sS'the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .'
p580
g2
sS']the best 4mp out there'
p581
g2
sS'that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .'
p582
g2
sS'the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .'
p583
g2
sS'you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .'
p584
g2
sS'they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .'
p585
g2
sS'trips .'
p586
g2
sS'i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .'
p587
g2
sS']if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital'
p588
g2
sS"if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !"
p589
g2
sS'the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .'
p590
g2
sS']love my new g 3'
p591
g2
sS"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !"
p592
g2
sS'it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .'
p593
g2
sS"i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck ."
p594
g2
sS']knock your socks off great'
p595
g2
sS'i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .'
p596
g2
sS'i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .'
p597
g4
sS'to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .'
p598
g2
sS"this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time ."
p599
g4
sS'the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !'
p600
g2
sS"i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways ."
p601
g2
sS"it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments ."
p602
g2
sS"- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull ."
p603
g2
sS'now what about the flash problem ?'
p604
g2
sS"yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash ."
p605
g2
sS"the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own ."
p606
g2
sS'i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .'
p607
g4
sS'bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .'
p608
g2
sS'while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .'
p609
g6
sS'after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .'
p610
g2
sS'i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .'
p611
g2
sS']excellent for the semi-serious amateur'
p612
g2
sS'i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !'
p613
g2
sS'the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .'
p614
g4
sS']the catch'
p615
g2
sS'especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .'
p616
g2
sS'seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .'
p617
g4
sS'the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .'
p618
g4
sS"the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class ."
p619
g4
sS'i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .'
p620
g2
sS'i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :'
p621
g4
sS'Review Source: amazon.com'
p622
g2
sS'not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .'
p623
g2
sS'for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .'
p624
g2
sS'flaws ?'
p625
g2
sS'you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .'
p626
g4
sS'and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?'
p627
g2
sS'the canon g3 .'
p628
g2
sS"after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product ."
p629
g2
sS'i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .'
p630
g2
sS'if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .'
p631
g2
sS']100 % happy'
p632
g2
sS'i always shoot using the lcd panel .'
p633
g2
sS'this seemed like a really good compromise .'
p634
g2
sS'when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .'
p635
g2
sS'the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .'
p636
g4
sS"overall i 'm happy with my toy ."
p637
g4
sS'four megapixels is great .'
p638
g4
sS'i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .'
p639
g2
sS'this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .'
p640
g2
sS'the g3 looks like a work of art !'
p641
g4
sS'i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .'
p642
g4
sS'despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .'
p643
g4
sS"it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !"
p644
g2
sS"the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to ."
p645
g4
sS'prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .'
p646
g2
sS"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better ."
p647
g6
sS"it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features ."
p648
g4
sS"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture ."
p649
g6
sS'absolutely breathtaking .'
p650
g2
sS'i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !'
p651
g2
sS'the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .'
