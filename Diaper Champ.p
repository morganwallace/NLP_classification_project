S'WRONG!'

sS"No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'"

S'pos'
p4
sS'You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.'
p5
g2
sS'There is also no trick to it.'
p6
g2
sS'There is no odor and extremely easy to use.'
p7
g4
sS'So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.'
p8
g2
sS'I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.'
p9
g2
sS'We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.'
p10
g2
sS'The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.'
p11
S'neg'
p12
sS'I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.'
p13
g4
sS'For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.'
p14
g12
sS"And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space."
p15
g4
sS"Don't buy the diaper champ."
p16
g12
sS'This is a GREAT product!'
p17
g4
sS'Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.'
p18
g2
sS'At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!'
p19
g4
sS'The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.'
p20
g12
sS'I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!'
p21
g4
sS'Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.'
p22
g12
sS'Let the Champ win you over!'
p23
g4
sS'This is a great diaper pail.'
p24
g4
sS"My second child I didn't get any."
p25
g2
sS'With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.'
p26
g4
sS'I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?'
p27
g2
sS'First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.'
p28
g4
sS'Even when empty!'
p29
g2
sS"I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations."
p30
g2
sS'It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!'
p31
g2
sS'We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.'
p32
g12
sS' We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.'
p33
g2
sS"Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them."
p34
g2
sS"Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke."
p35
g4
sS'Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!'
p36
g2
sS"If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that."
p37
g2
sS'Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.'
p38
g2
sS'The reviews were definitely right.'
p39
g2
sS'look at the size of it!'
p40
g4
sS'I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.'
p41
g2
sS'Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.'
p42
g2
sS'Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.'
p43
g4
sS'Highly recommended!!!'
p44
g2
sS'We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.'
p45
g4
sS'We all hated it.'
p46
g2
sS'I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.'
p47
g4
sS'Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.'
p48
g12
sS'But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.'
p49
g12
sS'We liked it because:'
p50
g2
sS"No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!"
p51
g4
sS'We decided we had to have something so we started researching.'
p52
g2
sS'This is really a nice diaper pail.'
p53
g4
sS'The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!'
p54
g2
sS'I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.'
p55
g12
sS'And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!'
p56
g4
sS'I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.'
p57
g2
sS'I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.'
p58
g2
sS'Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!'
p59
g4
sS'There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!'
p60
g4
sS"We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure."
p61
g2
sS'*holds the odor in nicely!'
p62
g4
sS'THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.'
p63
g4
sS'I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.'
p64
g12
sS'It was such a pain to use.'
p65
g2
sS'The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.'
p66
g2
sS"The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room."
p67
g2
sS"I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!"
p68
g4
sS'Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!'
p69
g4
sS'My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.'
p70
g2
sS"Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!"
p71
g2
sS'However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -'
p72
g2
sS'We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.'
p73
g2
sS'Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.'
p74
g2
sS'2) The Champ uses regular store bags.'
p75
g4
sS'With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.'
p76
g2
sS"I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills."
p77
g4
sS"The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are."
p78
g12
sS'The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.'
p79
g4
sS'Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.'
p80
g2
sS"But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function."
p81
g12
sS'I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.'
p82
g4
sS'2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.'
p83
g4
sS"Can't complain at all!"
p84
g2
sS'Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.'
p85
g2
sS"But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop."
p86
g2
sS'So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!'
p87
g4
sS'(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!'
p88
g4
sS'I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.'
p89
g4
sS"It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work."
p90
g4
sS'unlike the Diaper Genie!'
p91
g2
sS'That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.'
p92
g2
sS'Go for the Champ.'
p93
g4
sS'We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.'
p94
g2
sS'We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.'
p95
g2
sS'Only problem.'
p96
g2
sS'We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.'
p97
g4
sS"So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all."
p98
g4
sS"It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon)."
p99
g4
sS' Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!'
p100
g12
sS"It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!)."
p101
g4
sS'I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.'
p102
g4
sS'I would not recommend buying that one.'
p103
g2
sS'The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.'
p104
g2
sS'Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.'
p105
g4
sS"In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ."
p106
g4
sS'Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.'
p107
g2
sS'Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?'
p108
g2
sS"Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!"
p109
g4
sS'My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.'
p110
g12
sS'I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.'
p111
g4
sS'I love this pail!'
p112
g4
sS'This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.'
p113
g4
sS"A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage."
p114
g2
sS'We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.'
p115
g4
sS"I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name."
p116
g2
sS'I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.'
p117
g2
sS'Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.'
p118
g4
sS"(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag."
p119
g4
sS"Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell."
p120
g12
sS'We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.'
p121
g12
sS'The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.'
p122
g4
sS"I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills."
p123
g4
sS"So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!"
p124
g4
sS'We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.'
p125
g4
sS"2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic."
p126
g2
sS'The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!'
p127
g4
sS'All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.'
p128
g4
sS"Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over."
p129
g4
sS'For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.'
p130
g2
sS"I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula."
p131
g2
sS"I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it."
p132
g12
sS'We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.'
p133
g2
sS'Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.'
p134
g4
sS"The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved."
p135
g12
sS'Also much less stinky.'
p136
g12
sS'Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.'
p137
g2
sS'Works great!!!!'
p138
g4
sS'I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.'
p139
g2
sS'(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.'
p140
g12
sS"It's far better than all others on the market."
p141
g4
sS'I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.'
p142
g2
sS'3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.'
p143
g4
sS'When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.'
p144
g2
sS'If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!'
p145
g4
sS'I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!'
p146
g4
sS'This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.'
p147
g2
sS"I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse."
p148
g2
sS'Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.'
p149
g4
sS'And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!'
p150
g4
sS'For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.'
p151
g2
sS'We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product'
p152
g2
sS"I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom."
p153
g2
sS'THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!'
p154
g4
sS'FANTASTIC!'
p155
g2
sS'My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it'
p156
g2
sS'So then I used straight bleach.'
p157
g2
sS'It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.'
p158
g2
sS'5.  The price is right.'
p159
g4
sS"Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore."
p160
g12
sS"I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags."
p161
g4
sS'No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!'
p162
g4
sS'and we still LOVE it!'
p163
g4
sS"Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?"
p164
g2
sS'This will never be a problem with the Champ.'
p165
g2
sS"Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first."
p166
g12
sS'Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.'
p167
g12
sS'For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.'
p168
g12
sS'Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.'
p169
g2
sS'Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.'
p170
g2
sS'It lives up to its name.'
p171
g2
sS'I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.'
p172
g12
sS'It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?'
p173
g4
sS"This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie."
p174
g2
sS'If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.'
p175
g2
sS'I couldn\'t picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"'
p176
g2
sS'It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.'
p177
g4
sS'There is no odor and it is very easy to use.'
p178
g4
sS"In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless."
p179
g12
sS'Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!'
p180
g2
sS'She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.'
p181
g2
sS'For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:'
p182
g2
sS'All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.'
p183
g12
sS'It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).'
p184
g4
sS'OK.'
p185
g2
sS"That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!"
p186
g12
sS'Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.'
p187
g2
sS"It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan."
p188
g2
sS'We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.'
p189
g4
sS"I think it's great."
p190
g4
sS'I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.'
p191
g2
sS'It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.'
p192
g4
sS'To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.'
p193
g12
sS'dirty diapes and soaked diapers.'
p194
g2
sS'If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.'
p195
g4
sS'It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.'
p196
g2
sS"We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!"
p197
g4
sS'As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.'
p198
g2
sS'The diaper champ is the best!'
p199
g4
sS'And it is very easy to clean.'
p200
g4
sS'CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.'

p207
g2

p208
g4
sS'4 months later.'

g2

p214
g4

p225
g12
sS'I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.'
p226
g2
sS'A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!'
p227
g4
sS'I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.'
p228

p229
g12
sS'Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.'

g4
sS"I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen."

sS"it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills."
p246
g4
sS'Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.'
p247
g4
sS'This one is really great.'
p248
g4
sS'This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.'
p249
g4
sS"And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills."
p250
g4
sS'It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!'
p251
g4
sS'And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.'
p252
g2
sS'Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.'
p253
g2
sS"There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while."
p254
g2
sS'So far so good.'
p255
g2
sS'SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!'
p256
g4
sS"But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying."
p257
g4
sS"1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!"
p258
g4
sS'I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.'
p259
g4
sS'We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).'
p260
g4
sS"In concept, it's a fabulous idea."
p261
g2
sS'2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!'
p262
g12
sS'Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!'
p263
g12
sS'All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.'
p264
g2
sS'Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!'
p265
g2
sS'Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.'
p266
g4
sS'I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.'
p267
g2
sS'I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).'
p268
g2
sS'It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!'
p269
g4
sS"We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!"
p270
g4
sS'We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.'
p271
g4
sS"it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash."
p272
g2
sS"I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail."
p273
g12
sS'I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.'
p274
g12
sS'The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.'
p275
g12
sS'As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn\'t really look full.'
p276
g12
sS'It definitely keeps the smell out.'
p277
g4
sS"The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use."
p278
g4
sS'It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.'
p279
g4
sS"My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag."
p280
g12
sS'ANY Garbage bags will fit.'
p281
g2
sS'For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!'
p282
g2
sS'Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.'
p283
g12
sS'Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.'
p284
g2
sS"We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump."
p285
g2
sS'We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.'
p286
g2
sS"But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie."
p287
g4
sS'even did while daughter sleep and no noise!'
p288
g4
sS'It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.'
p289
g2
sS"She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard)."
p290
g2
sS"Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!"
p291
g4
sS"It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep."
p292
g2
sS"I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements."
p293
g4
sS'The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.'
p294
g2
sS'It also holds a lot more diapers.'
p295
g4
sS'While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.'
p296
g4
sS'Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!'
p297
g2
sS'The Champ works great.'
p298
g4
sS'Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.'
p299
g2
sS'I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.'
p300
g4
sS'The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.'
p301
g4
sS'Diaper Champ is great.'
p302
g4
sS'Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.'
p303
g2
sS'The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.'
p304
g12
sS'We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.'
p305
g2
sS"Here's what we love about this pail."
p306
g2
sS'He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".'
p307
g2
sS'I just know it really worked for us.'
p308
g2
sS'In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.'
p309
g2
sS'We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.'
p310
g12
sS'I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.'
p311
g4
sS'Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.'
p312
g2
sS'This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!'
p313
g4
sS'The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.'
p314
g2
sS'3.  Bags are easy to change.'
p315
g4
sS"The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend."
p316
g12
sS'It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.'
p317
g4
sS'The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.'
p318
g12
sS'The positives outway the negatives.'
p319
g2
sS"Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week."
p320
g2
sS'Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.'
p321
g2
sS"Don't listen to the bad reviews!"
p322
g2
sS"I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road."
p323
g2
sS'Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.'
p324
g2
sS'As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.'
p325
g2
sS"It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers."
p326
g4
sS"We've never experienced odor from the pail."
p327
g4
sS'Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.'
p328
g2
sS'One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.'
p329
g2
sS'You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.'
p330
g2
sS"We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers."
p331
g4
sS'I am very pleased with our choice.'
p332
g2
sS'and what a Godsend!'
p333
g2
sS'The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.'
p334
g4
sS'it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.'
p335
g12
sS'The Diaper Champ is the best we found!'
p336
g4
sS'Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!'
p337
g2
sS"It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside."
p338
g4
sS"I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills."
p339
g4
sS'The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.'
p340
g4
sS"There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ."
p341
g4
sS'Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!'
p342
g2
sS'I can honestly speak to its worth!'
p343
g2
sS'It works with a minimum of fuss.'
p344
g4
sS'Presto!'
p345
g2
sS'I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...'
p346
g4
sS'Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.'
p347
g4
sS'That would be my only complaint.'
p348
g2
sS'I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.'
p349
g2
sS'(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).'
p350
g4
sS'Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)'
p351
g4
sS'I highly recommend this!'
p352
g4
sS'My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.'
p353
g2
sS"I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that."
p354
g2
sS'You will be sorry after a few months.'
p355
g2
sS'Every time!'
p356
g2
sS"I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby)."
p357
g4
sS'Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!'
p358
g2
sS"I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!"
p359
g12
sS'It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.'
p360
g12
sS'I am soooo pleased with this product!!!'
p361
g4
sS"My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie."
p362
g2
sS'The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.'
p363
g12
sS'I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.'
p364
g12
sS'My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.'
p365
g2
sS"The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby."
p366
g4
sS'We hated that thing!'
p367
g2
sS'This is one of the best purchases we made.'
p368
g4
sS'No spinning it or anyhting!'
p369
g2
sS'It is mindless to operate.'
p370
g4
sS'But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.'
p371
g12
sS"I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in."
p372
g2
sS'For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.'
p373
g2
sS'To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.'
p374
g2
sS'The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.'
p375
g12
sS'Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.'
p376
g2
sS'1) The champ is easy to use.'
p377
g4
sS'I love this product!'
