tp49
a(S"I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills."

p76
g5
tp77
a(S'1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.'
p78
g2
tp79
a(S"2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic."
p80
g5
tp81
a(S'3. It never smelled - at all.'
p82
g2
tp83
a(S"Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them."
p84
g5
tp85
a(S"I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations."
p86
g5
tp87
a(S'I just know it really worked for us.'
p88
g5
tp89
a(S"The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby."
p90
g2
tp91
a(S"We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump."

p106
g5
tp107
a(S'ANY Garbage bags will fit.'
p108
g5
tp109
a(S"The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend."
p110

p112
g2
tp113
a(S'FANTASTIC!'
p114
g5
tp115
a(S"I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail."
p116
g42
tp117
a(S"My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag."
p118
g42
tp119
a(S"The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are."
p120
g42
tp121
a(S"I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road."
p122
g5
tp123
a(S"This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie."
p124
g5

a(S'and what a Godsend!'
p130
g5
tp131
a(S'It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?'
p132
g2
tp133

p134
g2
tp135
a(S'look at the size of it!'
p136
g2
tp137
a(S'Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.'
p138
g5
tp139
a(S"I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it."
p140
g42
tp141
a(S'unlike the Diaper Genie!'
p142
g5
tp143
a(S'I highly recommend this!'
p144
g2
tp145
a(S'For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.'
p146
g42
tp147
a(S'I would not recommend buying that one.'
p148
g5
tp149
a(S"My second child I didn't get any."
p150
g5
tp151
a(S'Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.'
p152
g5
tp153
a(S'I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.'
p154
g2
tp155
a(S'I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.'
p156
g5
tp157
a(S"I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements."
p158
g2
tp159
a(S"It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers."
p160
g2
tp161
a(S"I haven't noticed any seepage of smells."
p162
g5
tp163
a(S"My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie."
p164
g5
tp165
a(S'Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.'
p166
g5
tp167
a(S'The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.'
p168
g2
tp169
a(S'Presto!'
p170
g5
tp171
a(S'Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.'
p172
g5
tp173
a(S"But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function."
p174
g42
tp175
a(S'(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.'
p176
g42
tp177
a(S"A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage."
p178
g5
tp179
a(S'Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.'
p180
g5

p190
g5
tp191
a(S"The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use."
p192
g2
tp193
a(S"And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills."
p194
g2
tp195
a(S'It takes regular trash bags.'
p196
g5
tp197
a(S'I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.'
p198
g5
tp199
a(S'And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!'
p200
g2
tp201
a(S'If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!'
p202
g2
tp203
a(S'It was a PAIN.'
p204
g5
tp205
a(S'Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.'
p206
g5
tp207
a(S"it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash."
p208
g5
tp209
a(S'THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.'
p210
g2
tp211
a(S'For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.'
p212
g5
tp213
a(S"I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen."
p214
g5
tp215
a(S'Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!'
p216
g2
tp217
a(S'It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!'
p218
g2
tp219
a(S"It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!)."
p220
g2
tp221
a(S"It's also easy to empty out."
p222
g2
tp223
a(S'Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.'
p224
g5
tp225
a(S'And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!'
p226
g2
tp227
a(S'Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!'
p228
g2
tp229
a(S'My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.'
p230
g5
tp231
a(S'As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.'
p232
g5
tp233
a(S"She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard)."
p234
g5
tp235
a(S'Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!'
p236
g2
tp237
a(S'Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.'
p238
g42
tp239
a(S'Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.'
p240
g2
tp241
a(S"If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that."
p242
g5
tp243
a(S'As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn\'t really look full.'
p244
g42
tp245
a(S"But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying."
p246
g2
tp247
a(S'This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.'
p248
g2
tp249
a(S"I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name."
p250
g5
tp251
a(S"It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep."
p252
g5
tp253
a(S'Go for the Champ.'
p254
g2
tp255
a(S'It lives up to its name.'
p256
g5
tp257
a(S'I love this product!'
p258
g2
tp259
a(S'With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.'
p260
g2
tp261
a(S'Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.'
p262
g2
tp263
a(S'No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!'
p264
g2
tp265
a(S'and we still LOVE it!'
p266
g2
tp267
a(S'We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.'
p268
g5
tp269
a(S'We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.'
p270
g5
tp271
a(S"Here's what we love about this pail."
p272
g5
tp273
a(S'*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!'
p274
g2
tp275
a(S'(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!'
p276
g2
tp277
a(S'*holds the odor in nicely!'
p278
g2
tp279
a(S"(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag."
p280
g2
tp281
a(S'Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.'
p282
g5
tp283
a(S"We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers."
p284
g2
tp285
a(S'It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.'
p286
g2
tp287
a(S'I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.'
p288
g2
tp289
a(S"The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved."
p290
g42
tp291
a(S'It works with a minimum of fuss.'
p292
g2
tp293

p300

tp301
a(S'Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.'
p302
g2
tp303
a(S"Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!"
p304
g2
tp305
a(S"There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ."
p306
g2
tp307
a(S'I love this pail!'
p308
g2
tp309
a(S"No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!"
p310
g2
tp311
a(S"I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom."

a(S'I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.'
p400
g5
tp401
a(S'No need for deodorizers.'
p402
g2
tp403
a(S'I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.'
p404
g2
tp405
a(S'even did while daughter sleep and no noise!'
p406
g2
tp407
a(S"I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!"
p408
g2
tp409
a(S'This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.'
p410
g2
tp411
a(S'When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.'
p412
g5
tp413
a(S"We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure."
p414
g5
tp415
a(S'We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.'
p416
g42
tp417
a(S'We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.'
p418
g42
tp419
a(S'We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.'
p420
g42
tp421
a(S'This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.'
p422
g5
tp423
a(S'I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.'
p424
g5
tp425
a(S"But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie."
p426
g2
tp427
a(S"It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work."
p428
g2
tp429
a(S'At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!'
p430
g2
tp431
a(S'It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.'
p432
g5
tp433
a(S'I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.'
p434
g5
tp435
a(S"The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room."
p436
g5
tp437
a(S'She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.'
p438
g5
tp439
a(S'Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.'
p440
g2
tp441
a(S'It is mindless to operate.'
p442
g2
tp443
a(S'It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.'
p444
g5
tp445
a(S"It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon)."
p446
g2
tp447
a(S'And it is very easy to clean.'
p448
g2
tp449
a(S'I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.'
p450
g2
tp451
a(S'I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.'
p452
g5
tp453
a(S"I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in."
p454
g5
tp455
a(S'I am very pleased with our choice.'
p456
g5
tp457
a(S'This is a great diaper pail.'
p458
g2
tp459
a(S'There is no odor and it is very easy to use.'
p460
g2
tp461
a(S'(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).'
p462
g2
tp463
a(S"And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space."
p464
g2
tp465
a(S'We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.'
p466
g5
tp467
a(S'and we definitely prefer our Champ!'
p468
g2
tp469
a(S'Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.'
p470
g2
tp471
a(S'Only problem.'
p472
g5
tp473
a(S'it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.'
p474
g42
tp475
a(S'The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.'
p476
g42
tp477
a(S'I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.'
p478
g42
tp479
a(S'For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.'
p480
g42
tp481
a(S'The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.'
p482
g42
tp483
a(S'All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.'
p484
g42
tp485
a(S'I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.'
p486
g2
tp487
a(S'It works great.'
p488
g2
tp489
a(S"I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby)."
p490
g2
tp491
a(S'I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.'
p492
g2
tp493
a(S"It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan."
p494
g5
tp495
a(S'The reviews were definitely right.'
p496
g5
tp497
a(S'We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.'
p498
g2
tp499
a(S'It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).'
p500
g2
tp501
a(S'It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.'
p502
g2
tp503
a(S'As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.'
p504
g5
tp505
a(S'For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.'
p506
g5
tp507
a(S"Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week."
p508
g5
tp509
a(S'We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).'
p510
g2
tp511
a(S'It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!'
p512
g2
tp513
a(S'Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)'
p514
g2
tp515
a(S'I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.'
p516
g5
tp517
a(S"I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags."
p518
g2
tp519
a(S' Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!'
p520
g42
tp521
a(S'THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!'
p522
g2
tp523
a(S'I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!'
p524
g2
tp525
a(S"No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'"
p526
g2
tp527
a(S"In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ."
p528
g2
tp529
a(S'For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:'
p530
g5
tp531
a(S'1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!'
p532
g5
tp533
a(S'I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.'
p534
g5
tp535
a(S'For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!'
p536
g5
tp537
a(S'Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.'
p538
g5
tp539
a(S'2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!'
p540
g42
tp541
a(S'Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!'
p542
g5
tp543
a(S'All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.'
p544
g5
tp545
a(S'SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!'
p546
g2
tp547
a(S"Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!"
p548
g42
tp549
a(S'In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.'
p550
g5
tp551
a(S'Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!'
p552
g5
tp553
a(S'All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.'
p554
g2
tp555
a(S"I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills."
p556
g2
tp557
a(S'The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.'
p558
g42
tp559
a(S'I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.'
p560
g42
tp561
a(S' We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.'
p562
g5
tp563
a(S"That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!"
p564
g42
tp565
a(S'Even when empty!'
p566
g5
tp567
a(S'So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.'
p568
g5
tp569
a(S'It still smelled.'
p570
g42
tp571
a(S'So then I used straight bleach.'
p572
g5
tp573
a(S'That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.'
p574
g5
tp575
a(S'Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.'
p576
g42
tp577
a(S'However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -'
p578
g5
tp579
a(S'Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.'
p580
g2
tp581
a(S'The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.'
p582
g2
tp583
a(S"Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over."
p584
g2
tp585
a(S'CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.'
p586
g42
tp587
a(S'Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.'
p588
g42
tp589
a(S"Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first."
p590
g42
tp591
a(S'My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it'
p592
g5
tp593
a(S" (Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)"
p594
g5
tp595
a(S"I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended."
p596
g2
tp597
a(S'The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.'
p598
g42
tp599
a(S'The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.'
p600
g42
tp601
a(S"I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it."
p602
g42
tp603
a(S'That would be my only complaint.'
p604
g5
tp605
a(S'This is a GREAT product!'
p606
g2
tp607
a(S'I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.'
p608
g42
tp609
a(S'Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?'
p610
g5
tp611
a(S"I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula."
p612
g5
tp613
a(S'I couldn\'t picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"'
p614
g5
tp615
a(S'The Champ works great.'
p616
g2
tp617
a(S'We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.'
p618
g2
tp619
a(S"We've never experienced odor from the pail."
p620
g2
tp621
a(S'It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.'
p622
g2
tp623
a(S'I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...'
p624
g2
tp625
a(S'Highly recommended!!!'
p626
g5
tp627
a(S"Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!"
p628
g5
tp629
a(S'Excellent diaper disposal unit.'
p630
g2
tp631
a(S'I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).'
p632
g5
tp633
a(S'I am soooo pleased with this product!!!'
p634
g2
tp635
a(S'A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!'
p636
g2
tp637
a(S'Diaper Champ is great.'
p638
g2
tp639
a(S"But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop."
p640
g5
tp641
a(S"So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!"
p642
g2
tp643
a(S'Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.'
p644
g2
tp645
a(S'It works easily with one hand, which is important.'
p646
g2
tp647
a(S'Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.'
p648
g2
tp649
a(S'While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.'
p650
g2
tp651
a(S"Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore."
p652
g42
tp653
a(S'Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.'
p654
g42
tp655
a(S'Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.'
p656
g5
tp657
a(S'I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.'
p658
g42
tp659
a(S'Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.'
p660
g5
tp661
a(S'Also much less stinky.'
p662
g42
tp663
a(S"Don't buy the diaper champ."
p664
g42
tp665
a(S'You will be sorry after a few months.'
p666
g5
tp667
a(S'So far so good.'
p668
g5
tp669
a(S'I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.'
p670
g2
tp671
a(S'I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?'
p672
g5
tp673
a(S'Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.'
p674
g5
tp675
a(S'I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.'
p676
g2
tp677
a(S'Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.'
p678
g5
tp679
a(S'This one is really great.'
p680
g2
tp681
a(S'I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.'
p682
g2
tp683
a(S'I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.'
p684
g5
tp685
a(S"Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!"
p686
g2
tp687
a(S'We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.'
p688
g5
tp689
a(S'The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!'
p690
g2
tp691
a(S'We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.'
p692
g2
tp693
a(S"We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!"
p694
g2
tp695
a(S'We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.'
p696
g2
tp697
a(S'Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!'
p698
g5
tp699
a(S"Don't listen to the bad reviews!"
p700
g5
tp701
a(S'This is really a nice diaper pail.'
p702
g2
tp703
a(S'I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.'
p704
g2
tp705
a(S"In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room."
p706
g2
tp707
a(S'Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.'
p708
g5
tp709
a(S"Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke."
p710
g2
tp711
a(S'I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.'
p712
g2
tp713
a(S"1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!"
p714
g2
tp715
a(S'We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.'
p716
g2
tp717
a(S"We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!"
p718
g2
tp719
a(S'2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.'
p720
g2
tp721
a(S'So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!'
p722
g2
tp723
a(S'With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.'
p724
g5
tp725
a(S'The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.'
p726
g2
tp727
a(S'He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".'
p728
g5
tp729
a(S'3.  Bags are easy to change.'
p730
g2
tp731
a(S'Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.'
p732
g5
tp733
a(S'To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.'
p734
g5
tp735
a(S'It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.'
p736
g5
tp737
a(S'It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!'
p738
g5
tp739
a(S'Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.'
p740
g42
tp741
a(S'Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!'
p742
g5
tp743
a(S'To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.'
p744
g42
tp745
a(S'Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.'
p746
g5
tp747
a(S'Works great!!!!'
p748
g2
tp749
a(S'5.  The price is right.'
p750
g2
tp751
a(S"At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room."
p752

tp753
a.
