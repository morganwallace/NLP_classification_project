S'pos'
p2
tp3
a(S'It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up.'
p4
g2
tp5
a(S'By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.'
p6
g2
tp7
a(S'It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.'
p8
g2
tp9
a(S'That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.'

S'neutral'
p11
tp12
a(S'It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.'
p13
g2
tp14
a(S'There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it.'
p15
g2
tp16
a(S'I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !'
p17
g11
tp18
a(S'apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not.'
p19
g11
tp20
a(S'Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!'
p21
g2
tp22
a(S"It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality."
p23
g11
tp24
a(S"If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine."
p25
g11
tp26
a(S'I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.'
p27
g11
tp28
a(S'The Wizard is particularly sinister.'
p29
S'neg'
p30
tp31
a(S'It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.'
p32
g30
tp33
a(S'After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.'
p34
g11
tp35
a(S'These are just some of the pathetic examples.'
p36
g11
tp37
a(S'They!'

a(S'provide no printed manual.'
p40
g11
tp41
a(S'I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.'
p42
g11
tp43
a(S'Stupid me.'
p44
g11
tp45
a(S'It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.'
p46
g11
tp47
a(S'But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?'
p48
g11
tp49
a(S'No, of course not.'
p50
g11
tp51
a(S'You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.'
p52
g11
tp53
a(S'The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.'
p54
g30
tp55
a(S"It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way."
p56
g11
tp57
a(S"I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better."
p58
g11
tp59
a(S"If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website."
p60
g11
tp61
a(S'I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.'
p62
g2
tp63
a(S'I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.'
p64
g11
tp65
a(S'(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)'
p66
g11
tp67
a(S'HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.'
p68
g30
tp69
a(S'I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.'
p70
g11
tp71
a(S'But wh!'
p72
g11
tp73
a(S'en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.'
p74
g11
tp75
a(S"Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac."
p76
g30
tp77
a(S"(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later."
p78
g11
tp79
a(S') After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.'
p80
g11
tp81
a(S"I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless."
p82
g30
tp83
a(S'The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac.'
p84
g30
tp85
a(S"It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something."
p86
g11
tp87
a(S'But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it.'
p88
g11
tp89
a(S'I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!'
p90
g30
tp91
a(S'meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.'
p92
g11
tp93
a(S'The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.'
p94
g11
tp95
a(S'What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!'
p96
g30
tp97
a(S'! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.'
p98
g11
tp99
a(S"I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere."
p100
g11
tp101
a(S"* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable."
p102
g30
tp103
a(S'But the product iself is great.'
p104
g2
tp105
a(S"If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product."
p106
g11
tp107
a(S"Once you set it up, it's great."
p108
g2
tp109
a(S"And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting."
p110
g2
tp111
a(S"Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure."
p112
g11
tp113
a(S'For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.'
p114
g11
tp115
a(S'What about hookup and use?'
p116
g11
tp117
a(S'Another 5 star performance.'
p118
g2
tp119
a(S'Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD.'
p120
g11
tp121
a(S'They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.'
p122
g11
tp123
a(S'Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box.'
p124
g11
tp125
a(S"I'm glad I did."
p126
g11
tp127
a(S'This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.'
p128
g2
tp129
a(S'Shutting off what they t!'
p130
g11
tp131
a(S'ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.'
p132
g11
tp133
a(S'Not even one glitch.'
p134
g11
tp135
a(S'The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.'
p136
g11
tp137
a(S'I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.'
p138
g11
tp139
a(S'Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.'
p140
g11
tp141
a(S'No Wires !'
p142
g11
tp143
a(S'Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.'
p144
g2
tp145
a(S'When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.'
p146
g11
tp147
a(S"Let's get a perspective here."
p148
g11
tp149
a(S'A standard modem works at 56K tops.'
p150
g11
tp151
a(S"This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte."
p152
g2
tp153
a(S'Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.'
p154
g11
tp155
a(S'So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.'
p156
g11
tp157
a(S'I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!'
p158
g2
tp159
a(S'nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.'
p160
g11
tp161
a(S'I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card.'
p162
g11
tp163
a(S"What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network."
p164
g11
tp165
a(S'Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.'
p166
g2
tp167
a(S'As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.'
p168
g11
tp169
a(S'Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.'
p170
g11
tp171
a(S'The operating system is Windows XP.'
p172
g11
tp173
a(S'Installation was as near automatic as can be.'
p174
g2
tp175
a(S'They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.'
p176
g11
tp177
a(S'All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.'
p178
g2
tp179
a(S'Follow the directions exactly.'
p180
g11
tp181
a(S'It is easy.'
p182
g11
tp183
a(S'Hope this helps.'
p184
g11
tp185
a(S'I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.'
p186
g30
tp187
a(S'Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.'
p188
g11
tp189
a(S'Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.'
p190
g2
tp191
a(S'New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.'
p192
g2
tp193
a(S'All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.'
p194
g2
tp195
a(S'Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.'
p196
g2
tp197
a(S'Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.'
p198
g2
tp199
a(S'You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.'
p200
g2
tp201
a(S'Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.'
p202
g30
tp203
a(S'But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.'
p204
g11
tp205
a(S"Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !"
p206
g11
tp207
a(S'It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.'
p208
g11
tp209
a(S'I had an old wired Linksys router.'
p210
g11
tp211
a(S'The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.'
p212
g11
tp213
a(S'There was a big sticker inside the box saying "RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER".'
p214
g11
tp215
a(S'And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.'
p216
g11
tp217
a(S'So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.'
p218
g11
tp219
a(S'There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.'
p220
g30
tp221
a(S'If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.'
p222
g11
tp223
a(S'But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.'
p224
g11
tp225
a(S'I do know what wires go !'
p226
g11
tp227
a(S'to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.'
p228
g11
tp229
a(S'So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.'
p230
g11
tp231
a(S'The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.'
p232
g30
tp233
a(S'There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.'
p234
g11
tp235
a(S"If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly."
p236
g11
tp237
a(S'But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.'
p238
g11
tp239
a(S'The router works fine for both wired and wireless.'
p240
g2
tp241
a(S'I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.'
p242
g2
tp243
a(S'Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.'
p244
g2
tp245
a(S'But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.'
p246
g11
tp247
a(S'I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !'
p248
g11
tp249
a(S'little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.'
p250
g30
tp251
a(S"I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars."
p252
g2
tp253
a(S'Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.'
p254
g11
tp255
a(S'This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.'
p256
g30
tp257
a(S"You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line."
p258
g11
tp259
a(S'People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.'
p260
g11
tp261
a(S'They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money.'
p262
g11
tp263
a(S'That aside, this is not that bad of a product.'
p264
g11
tp265
a(S'I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.'
p266
g2
tp267
a(S'With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.'
p268
g11
tp269
a(S'If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.'
p270

a(S'P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!'
p272
g11
tp273
a(S'all kinds.'
p274
g11
tp275
a(S'On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.'
p276
g11
tp277
a(S'Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.'
p278
g11
tp279
a(S'So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).'
p280
g11
tp281
a(S'The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be. ##However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.'
p282
g11
tp283
a(S'The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half.'
p284
g30
tp285
a(S"Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware."

tp287
a(S'However, if you are not a tech person and!'
p288
g11
tp289

tp291
a(S'Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.'
p292
g11
tp293
a(S'Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.'
p294
g11
tp295
a(S'All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.'
p296
g11
tp297
a(S'If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.'
p298

tp299
a(S'They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux.'
p300
g11
tp301
a(S'I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.'
p302
g2
tp303
a(S'I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.'
p304

p308
g11
tp309

p310
g11
tp311

g11
tp317
a(S"That didn't work either."
p318

p320
g11
tp321
a(S'No hold time.'
p322
g11
tp323
a(S'Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.'
