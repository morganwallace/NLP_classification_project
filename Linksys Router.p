p63
g2
sS'The router works fine for both wired and wireless.'
p64
g2
sS"However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all."
p65
g2

p67
g4

p73
g4
sS'Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.'
p74
g4
sS'I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.'
p75
g20
sS"Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity."
p76
g2
sS'For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.'
p77
g4
sS'With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.'
p78
g4
sS'Not even one glitch.'
p79
g4

p80
g4
sS'However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.'
p81
g2
sS'All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.'
p82
g4

p83
g2
sS'They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money.'

p91
g2
sS'If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.'
p92
g4
sS'But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.'
p93
g4
sS'Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.'
p94
g4
sS'Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.  ##What about the wireless capability, you ask.'

g4
sS'Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.'
p96
g20

p105
g4
sS'In my oppinion,!'
p106
g4
sS'Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.'
p107
g20
sS'It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.'
p108
g2
sS'The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half.'

p134
g4

p137
g4
sS"In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router."
p138

p159
g4
sS'The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.'
p160

p212
g2
sS'OK, I never read the manual.'
p213
