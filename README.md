For: Natural Language Processing - Fall 2013
=========================

Plan:
1. Parse (Sonali -with help from others)
2. Feature creation (All)
3. Refine

*On 'Morgans_features' branch I have made a parser. It returns pickled files
".p." to the current directory if you have the 'product_data_training_heldout'
directory above this file (at same level as this directory).

The ".p" files each contain a dictionary with the sentence as key, and the 
value being another dictionary with attributes as key and sentiment score as the value.

**For some reason my git email was Jim Blomo's - that's why the commits were coming from him. I changed it to mine. So do not be confused if you see that in the commit logs.
