p38
g2
tp39
a(S'As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).'

tp45
a(S'Anti-Spam is Good'

p82
g2
tp83
a(S'Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".'
p84
g5
tp85
a(S'This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.'

p94
g5
tp95
a(S'This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.'
p96
g2
tp97
a(S"They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all."
p98
g2
tp99
a(S'The biggest problem is the installation.'
p100
g2
tp101
a(S'Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.'

p104
g2

p106
g5
tp107
a(S'First, it serious, serious installation problems.'
p108
g2
tp109
a(S'Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.'
p110
g2
tp111
a(S'Since then, I have had one problem after another.'
p112
g5
tp113
a(S'To say that it is "buggy" would be the world\'s most profound understatement.'
p114
g5
tp115
a(S'Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.'
p116
g2
tp117
a(S'First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.'
p118
g2
tp119
a(S'When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.'
p120
g2
tp121
a(S"The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions."
p122
g2
tp123
a(S'Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.'
p124
g5
tp125
a(S'Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!'
p126
g5
tp127
a(S'Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).'
p128
g10
tp129
a(S'These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.'
p130
g10
tp131
a(S"But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate."
p132
g2
tp133
a(S'The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.'
p134
g2
tp135
a(S'Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton\'s own removal program.'
p136
g2
tp137
a(S'A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.'
p138
g2
tp139
a(S'Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.'
p140
g10
tp141
a(S'If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.'
p142
g2
tp143
a(S'You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.'
p144
g2
tp145
a(S'(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)'
p146
g5
tp147
a(S'Even this, however, did not solve my problems.'
p148
g5
tp149
a(S"As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec."
p150
g2
tp151
a(S'I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.'
p152
g2
tp153
a(S"Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians."
p154
g2
tp155
a(S"The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars."
p156
g2
tp157
a(S'Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.'
p158
g2
tp159

tp163
a(S'No longer.'
p164
g5
tp165
a(S'Avoid this product at all costs.'
p166
g2
tp167
a(S'Antagonising'
p168
g5
tp169
a(S'There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.'
p170
g2
tp171
a(S'The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.'
p172
g2
tp173
a(S'I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."'
p174
g2
tp175
a(S"Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one."
p176
g2
tp177
a(S"So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs)."
p178
g2
tp179
a(S"And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority."
p180
g2
tp181
a(S'I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.'
p182
g5
tp183
a(S'Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)'
p184
g5
tp185
a(S'I was totally baffled.'
p186
g5
tp187
a(S'I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.'
p188
g5
tp189
a(S'The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.'
p190
g5
tp191
a(S'This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.'
p192
g5
tp193
a(S"The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses."
p194
g5
tp195
a(S"If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest."
p196
g5
tp197
a(S"Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low."
p198
g10
tp199
a(S"It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory."
p200
g5
tp201
a(S'I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.'
p202
g10
tp203
a(S'Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.'
p204
g10
tp205
a(S"You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks."
p206
g10
tp207
a(S'The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.'
p208
g10
tp209

p212
g5
tp213

p216
g5
tp217
a(S'Stay away from this product!'
p218
g2
tp219
a(S"I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage."
p220
g2
tp221
a(S"Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site."
p222
g5
tp223
a(S'The customer support is pathetic.'
p224
g2
tp225
a(S'I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.'
p226
g2
tp227
a(S'Okay, how can I say this nicely?'
p228
g5
tp229
a(S'This product is absolutely not ready for release.'
p230
g2
tp231
a(S'It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.'
p232
g2
tp233
a(S'I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.'
p234
g2
tp235
a(S"Norton has a name in the market but I think it's only the name."
p236
g5
tp237
a(S"It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus."
p238
g2
tp239
a(S'The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.'
p240
g5
tp241
a(S'Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.'
p242
g2
tp243
a(S'Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.'
p244
g2
tp245
a(S'Had to uninstall it.'
p246
g5
tp247
a(S"Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program."
p248

tp249
a(S'I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.'
p250
g5

p252
g2
tp253
a(S"Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!"
p254
g2
tp255
a(S'I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.'
p256
g5

tp259
a(S"If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't."
p260
g2
tp261
a(S'There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.'
p262
g2
tp263
a(S'If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.'
p264
g2
tp265
a(S'It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.'
p266

a(S'This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.'
p268
g5
tp269
a(S'From day one, we\'ve had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.'

a(S'Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.'
p272

p274
g2

p276
g5
tp277
a(S"I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star."
p278
g5
tp279
a(S'Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.'
p280
g2
