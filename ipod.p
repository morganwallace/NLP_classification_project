tp10
a(S"My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history."

S'pos'
p14
tp15
a(S' The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.'

g2
tp17

p18
g9
tp19
a(S'The bass is deep and the treble is clear.'
p20
g14
tp21
a(S"  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months."
p22
g9
tp23
a(S"This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore."
p24
g2
tp25
a(S"iRiver's battery lasts four to five years."
p26
g2
tp27
a(S"Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE."
p28
g9
tp29
a(S" However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support."
p30
g2
tp31
a(S"The iPod's battery, 1.5 years."
p32
g2
tp33
a(S'Yeah, pretty weak.'
p34
g2
tp35
a(S' Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.'
p36
g9
tp37
a(S' While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.'
p38
g2
tp39
a(S' Also, not liking the gel case.'
p40
g9
tp41
a(S"iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's."
p42
g2
tp43
a(S" FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature."
p44
g9
tp45
a(S'There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.'

p52
g2
tp53
a(S"  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one."
p54
g14
tp55
a(S'The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).'
p56
g2
tp57
a(S"I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software."
p58
g9
tp59
a(S"I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it."
p60
g2
tp61
a(S" Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer."
p62
g2
tp63
a(S'Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.'
p64
g2
tp65
a(S' BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.'
p66
g2
tp67
a(S' CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier.'
p68
g9
tp69
a(S"If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty."
p70
g2
tp71
a(S'They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.'
p72
g2
tp73
a(S" There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it."
p74
g9
tp75
a(S"At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies."
p76
g2
tp77
a(S'OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.'
p78
g2
tp79
a(S"Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead."

p118
g2
tp119
a(S' The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.'
p120

p142
g14
tp143
a(S' The product I rate five stars,'
p144
g14
tp145

p148
g2
tp149
a(S' The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.'

g2
tp151
a(S'  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.'

p166
g14

p170
g14
tp171
a(S"I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds."
p172
g2
tp173
a(S' I use it to listen to language tapes and to play "Earl" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.'
p174
g2
tp175
a(S'It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.'

g2
tp179
a(S'Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.'
p180
g2

p182
g9
tp183
a(S' I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.'
p184
g2
tp185
a(S"Here's the TRUTH in short...."
p186
g2
tp187
a(S'This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.'
p188
g2
tp189
a(S' Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.'
p190
g14
tp191
a(S'Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"'
p192
g14
tp193
a(S'Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.'
p194
g14
tp195
a(S'12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.'
p196
g2
tp197
a(S' FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.'
p198
g14
tp199
a(S' Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.'
p200
g14
tp201
a(S'Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy'
p202
g14
tp203
a(S'Games-- not really important, but existant'
p204
g14
tp205
a(S"Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket."
p206
g14
tp207
a(S' Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing'
p208
g9
tp209
a(S"3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have."
p210
g9
tp211
a(S' No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient'
p212
g9
tp213
a(S'. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.'
p214
g14
tp215
a(S"No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium."
p216
g9
tp217
a(S'  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.'
p218
g14
tp219
a(S'  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.'
p220
g2
tp221
a(S" This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best."
p222
g2
tp223
a(S'Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead\t If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.'
p224
g2
tp225
a(S'I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.'
p226
g2
tp227
a(S' A sound decision and a happy customer right here!'
p228
g2
tp229
a(S" I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400."
p230
g2
tp231
a(S'The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!'
p232
g2
tp233
a(S"It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer."
p234
g2
tp235
a(S'No need to install the iTunes.'
p236
g2
tp237
a(S'Versatile and stylish.'
p238
g14
tp239
a(S"I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes."
p240
g14
tp241
a(S"The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement')."
p242
g9
tp243
a(S'The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed'
p244
g14
tp245
a(S"And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive."
p246
g2
tp247
a(S' The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.'
p248
g14
tp249
a(S'Still not so sure about this one...'
p250
g2
tp251
a(S' First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.'
p252
g9
tp253
a(S' So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.'
p254
g2
tp255
a(S"  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly."
p256
g2
tp257
a(S'In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.'
p258
g9
tp259
a(S'  Again, another hassle.'
p260
g2
tp261
a(S' To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.'
p262
g2
tp263
a(S'But enought of the negativity.'
p264
g2
tp265
a(S' I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.'
p266
g14
tp267
a(S' Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).'
p268
g2
tp269
a(S"Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use."
p270
g14
tp271
a(S"Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so."
p272
g2
tp273
a(S' I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.'
p274
g2
tp275
a(S" As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough."
p276
g14
tp277
a(S" I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that."
p278
g2
tp279
a(S'  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.'
p280
g2
tp281
a(S' In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.'
p282
g14
tp283
a(S"  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money."
p284
g2
tp285
a(S'Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.'
p286
g2
tp287
a(S" i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city."
p288
g2
tp289
a(S'when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!'
p290
g2
tp291

p294
g2
tp295
a(S'i didnt touch the product.'
p296
g2
tp297
a(S' i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.'
p298
g2
tp299
a(S' they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.'
p300
g2
tp301
a(S'then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.'
p302
g2
tp303
a(S' a week passed but it was never picked up.'
p304
g2
tp305
a(S" the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company."

g2
tp371
a(S'Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.'
p372

p386
g2
tp387
a(S" So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days..."

tp397
a(S"  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds."
p398
g14
tp399
a(S"However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations."
p400
g2
tp401
a(S" It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island."
p402
g2

a(S'After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.'
p406
g2
tp407
a(S' This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.'
p408
g2
tp409
a(S' So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.'
p410
g2
tp411
a(S"Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services."
p412
g9
tp413
a(S' This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.'
p414
g2
tp415
a(S'Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?'
p416
g2
tp417
a(S'  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.'
p418

p424
g2
tp425
a(S' If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.'
p426
g2
tp427
a(S'  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)'
p428
g2
tp429
a(S"  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life)."
p430
g2
tp431
a(S" Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)"
p432
g2
tp433
a(S"Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics."
p434
g2
tp435
a(S"They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so."
p436
g2
tp437
a(S'Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years.'
p438
g2
tp439
a(S'No big deal.'
p440
g2
tp441
a(S'You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.'

p464

p466
g14
tp467
a(S'As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.'
p468
g9
tp469
a(S'The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes).'
p470
g2
tp471
a(S'Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.'
p472
g2
tp473
a(S" I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt."
p474
g14
tp475
a(S'  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.'
p476
g2
tp477
a(S'Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.'
p478
g2
tp479
a(S" That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB."
p480
g2
tp481
a(S"The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane."
p482
g2
tp483
a(S'The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.'
p484
g14
tp485
a(S"  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up."
p486
g9
tp487
a(S'(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!'
p488
g14
tp489
a(S' Still my favorite MP3 player\t Is it overpriced ?'
p490
g2
tp491
a(S' Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.'
p492
g2
tp493
a(S'  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.'
p494
g14
tp495
a(S"  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device."
p496
g2
tp497
a(S" Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal."
p498
g2
tp499
a(S" I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again."
p500
g2
tp501
a(S" And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own."
p502
g14
tp503
a(S"  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong."
p504
g9
tp505
a(S' I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.'
p506
g2
tp507
a(S"Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one."
p508
g2
tp509
a(S' I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !'
p510
g2
tp511
a(S"By far the best MP3 player I've ever used"
p512
g2
tp513
a(S' This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.'
p514
g2
tp515
a(S" If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it."
p516
g2
tp517
a(S'However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).'
p518
g2
tp519
a(S"I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly."
p520
g2
tp521
a(S"  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority."
p522
g14
tp523
a(S'For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.'
p524
g14
tp525
a(S' It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I\'m going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).'
p526
g2
tp527
a(S'  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.'
p528
g2
tp529
a(S'You can transfer music from one PC to the other.'
p530
g2
tp531
a(S' However, with the iPod you cannot.'
p532
g2
tp533
a(S'The music MUST be on your computer.'
p534
g2
tp535
a(S" If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work."
p536
g2
tp537
a(S'Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.'
p538
g2
tp539
a(S'They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).'
p540
g2
tp541
a(S' Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.'
p542
g9
tp543
a(S'Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.'
p544
g2
tp545
a(S" My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages."
p546
g2
tp547
a(S'I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.'
p548
g2
tp549
a(S'So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.'
p550
g2
tp551
a(S" The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference)."
p552
g2
tp553
a(S'Also, I don\'t like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.'
p554
g2
tp555
a(S' If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!'
p556
g2
tp557
a(S' This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.'
p558
g2
tp559
a(S"In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!"
p560
g2
tp561
a(S"Confused yet? Don't be."
p562
g2
tp563
a(S' This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music.'
p564
g2
tp565
a(S'The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.'
p566
g14
tp567
a(S"  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!"
p568
g2
tp569
a(S" The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days)."
p570
g14
tp571
a(S" The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc."
p572
g14
tp573
a(S' The list is endless.'
p574
g2
tp575
a(S' The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.'
p576
g2
tp577
a(S" I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!"
p578
g2
tp579
a(S' The!  sound quality is great.'
p580
g14
tp581
a(S'The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?'
p582
g14
tp583
a(S"Don't apply the black cushioned protectors."
p584
g2
tp585
a(S'First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."'
p586
g2
tp587
a(S' Just kidding.'
p588
g2
tp589
a(S" But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off."
p590
g2
tp591
a(S"But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear."
p592
g2
tp593
a(S" I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference."
p594
g2
tp595
a(S'  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.'
p596
g14
tp597
a(S' As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.'
p598
g2
tp599
a(S" With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive."
p600
g14
tp601
a(S'This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.'
p602
g2
tp603
a(S" I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos."
p604
g2
tp605
a(S'Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.'
p606
g14
tp607
a(S'The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.'
p608
g2
tp609
a(S"  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music."
p610
g2
tp611
a(S'When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it\'s not.'
p612
g2
tp613
a(S" It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes."
p614
g2
tp615
a(S"It's a good way to pass the time."
p616
g2
tp617
a(S'  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).'
p618
g14
tp619
a(S"  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need."
p620
g2
tp621
a(S" Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time."
p622
g2
tp623
a(S" If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently."
p624
g2
tp625
a(S' I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!'
p626
g2
tp627
a(S"It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything."
p628
g2
tp629
a(S'  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.'
p630
g14
tp631
a(S" At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain."
p632
g2
tp633
a(S' My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter'
p634
g2
tp635
a(S".  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market."
p636
g2
tp637
a(S"Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple."
p638
g2
tp639
a(S'Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW'
p640
g2
tp641
a(S' Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.'
p642
g2
tp643
a(S'However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.'
p644
g2
tp645
a(S'When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging.'
p646
g2
tp647
a(S' The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.'
p648
g2
tp649
a(S'  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.'
p650
g2
tp651
a(S' For this reason, it is very easy to drop.'
p652
g2
tp653
a(S'One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.'
p654
g2
tp655
a(S'  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.'
p656
g2
tp657
a(S'Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.'
p658
g14
tp659
a(S' To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.'
p660
g2
tp661
a(S' Organizing music is a breeze too.'
p662
g2
tp663
a(S' You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!'
p664
g2
tp665
a(S'Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.'
p666
g14
tp667
a(S'  It all sounds great too.'
p668
g14
tp669
a(S' As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.'
p670

tp671
a(S' I recommend Shures (shure.com).'
p672
g2
tp673
a(S" I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great."
p674
g2
tp675
a(S' You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.'
p676
g14
tp677
a(S'  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.'
p678
g2
tp679
a(S' The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.'
p680
g2
tp681
a(S'   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?'
p682
g2
tp683
a(S'Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY.'
p684
g9
tp685
a(S' To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com  ##Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.'
p686
g2
tp687
a(S"  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!"
p688
g9
tp689
a(S'    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.'
p690
g2
tp691
a(S'However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.'
p692

tp693
a(S' Hence, the one star rating...'

tp705
a(S" I'm not one of them."
p706
g2
tp707
a(S'  While I like the minimialism of the player, I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age.'
p708
g2
tp709
a(S'While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.'
p710
g2
tp711
a(S"The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches."
p712
g9
tp713
a(S"  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up."
p714
g2
tp715
a(S'THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.'
p716
g2
tp717
a(S' I disagree.'
p718
g2
tp719
a(S' I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.'
p720
g2
tp721
a(S' I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.'
p722
g2
tp723
a(S'As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me.'
p724
g2
tp725
a(S' Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.'
p726
g2
tp727
a(S' BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.'
p728
g9
tp729
a(S' The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe'
p730
g2
tp731
a(S" Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue."
p732
g2
tp733
a(S"IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up."
p734
g2
tp735
a(S" Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program."
p736
g2
tp737
a(S"  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works."
p738
g2
tp739
a(S"  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy."

a(S'\tPure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.'
p742
g2
tp743
a(S"\t If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one."
p744
g14
tp745
a(S'If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.'
p746
g2
tp747
a(S"This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB."
p748
g2
tp749
a(S'  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.'
p750
g2
tp751
a(S'Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.'
p752
g2
tp753
a(S'The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.'
p754
g2
tp755
a(S'Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.'
p756
g2
tp757
a(S'So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.'
p758
g14
tp759
a(S'  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.'
p760
g2
tp761
a(S' The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.'
p762
g2
tp763
a(S'But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.'
p764
g2
tp765
a(S" It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better."
p766
g2
tp767
a(S'For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.'
p768
g14
tp769
a(S' The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.'
p770
g14
tp771
a(S' Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.'
p772
g2
tp773
a(S'I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.'
p774
g2
tp775
a(S"Just don't drop it."
p776
g2
tp777
a(S' I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation.'
p778
g2
tp779
a(S" Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once)."
p780
g2
tp781
a(S" Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked."
p782
g2
tp783
a(S'Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.'
p784
g2
tp785
a(S'  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.'
p786
g2
tp787
a(S'  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.'
p788
g2
tp789
a(S'  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.'
p790
g2
tp791
a(S" Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products)."
p792
g2
tp793
a(S' I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I\'ve had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won\'t respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.'
p794
g2
tp795
a(S' When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.'
p796
g2
tp797
a(S"I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying."
p798
g2
tp799
a(S' Needless to say, these are fragile machines.'
p800
g2
tp801
a(S' Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.'
p802
g9
tp803
a(S"I don't really intend to drop mine to find out."
p804
g2
tp805
a(S" The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it."
p806
g2
tp807
a(S' Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.'
p808
g2
tp809
a(S"The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick."
p810
g2
tp811
a(S'But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.'
p812
g2
tp813
a(S' We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.'
p814
g9
tp815
a(S' The other thing is the earbuds.'
p816
g2
tp817
a(S"First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable."
p818
g9
tp819
a(S'  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.'
p820
g2
tp821
a(S' With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.'
p822
g2
tp823
a(S" And I'm really not that rough with things!"
p824
g2
tp825
a(S" These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one."
p826
g14
tp827
a(S'  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.'
p828
g2
tp829
a(S"  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software."
p830
g2
tp831
a(S"  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative."
p832
g9
tp833
a(S"Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything."
p834
g14
tp835
a(S'  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini'
p836
g2
tp837
a(S"A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general."
p838
g2
tp839
a(S" I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model."
p840
g2
tp841
a(S' I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.'
p842
g2
tp843
a(S"I'm glad I did."
p844
g2
tp845
a(S"  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G."
p846
g2
tp847
a(S' The player is great.'
p848
g14
tp849
a(S" I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory."
p850
g2
tp851
a(S" However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like."
p852
g9
tp853
a(S"There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips."
p854
g2
tp855
a(S' For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.'
p856
g2
tp857
a(S'  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.'
p858
g2
tp859
a(S' Overall, this product is AWESOME.'
p860
g14
tp861
a(S' All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.'

p878

a(S' The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.'
p894
g2
tp895
a(S' I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.'
p896
g2
tp897
a(S"Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people."

p902
g2
tp903
a(S" held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'."
p904
g2
tp905
a(S"I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives."
p906
g14
tp907
a(S'It was worth the wait.'
p908
g2
tp909
a(S"   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen."
p910
g2
tp911
a(S'It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.'
p912
g2
tp913
a(S' This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.'
p914
g14
tp915
a(S'Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.'
p916
g2
tp917
a(S'  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.'
p918
g14
tp919
a(S'Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.'
p920
g2
tp921
a(S'   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.'
p922
g2
tp923
a(S'Two DVDs to capture all 2,400 tracks.'
p924
g2
tp925
a(S'Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.'
p926
g2
tp927
a(S'The first battery charge lasted only about six hours.'
p928
g2
tp929
a(S'That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.'
p930
g2
tp931
a(S' The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.'
p932
g2
tp933
a(S' I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.'
p934
g2
tp935
a(S'I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.'
p936
g14
tp937
a(S' I bought the JBL Creature speakers for home use, and they work great with the iPod.'
p938
g2
tp939
a(S'Match them pretty well to boot.'
p940
g2
tp941
a(S' The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.'
p942
g2
tp943
a(S" It is sharper on the 'mini' units."
p944
g2
tp945
a(S'This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.'
p946
g9
tp947
a(S'The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.'
p948
g2
tp949
a(S"You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue."
p950
g2
tp951
a(S' The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.'

tp979
a(S"If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price."
p980

p982
g2
tp983
a(S"Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...\t I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio."
p984
g2
tp985
a(S" It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky."
p986
g2
tp987
a(S" I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands."
p988
g2
tp989
a(S' I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.'
p990
g2
tp991
a(S" It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below."
p992
g2
tp993
a(S"It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover."
p994
g2
tp995
a(S" The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable."
p996
g2
tp997
a(S"The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym."
p998
g14
tp999
a(S'I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.'
p1000
g14
tp1001
a(S'The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.'
p1002
g14
tp1003
a(S' It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.'
p1004
g2
tp1005
a(S'  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.'
p1006
g14
tp1007
a(S'A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.'
p1008
g2
tp1009
a(S'  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.'
p1010
g2
tp1011
a(S'  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.'
p1012
g2
tp1013
a(S'I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!'
p1014
g2
tp1015
a(S' I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.'
p1016
g14
tp1017
a(S"However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time."
p1018
g2
tp1019
a(S"  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt."
p1020
g2
tp1021
a(S"  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again."
p1022
g2
tp1023
a(S"  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload."
p1024
g2
tp1025
a(S' The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).'
p1026
g2
tp1027
a(S' I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.'
p1028
g2

p1052
g2
tp1053
a(S'Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?'
