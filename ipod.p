g2
sS"Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use."
p138
g2

p139
g4
sS"The user support service isn't too great either."
p140
g14
sS'Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.'
p141
g14
sS"Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need."
p142
g4
sS'Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?'
p143
g4

p170
g4

p171
g14
sS"iRiver's battery lasts four to five years."
p172
g4

p176
g4
sS'Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.'
p177
g4
sS'Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.'
p178
g4
sS'As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.'
p179
g4
sS'Think about that if you are worried about battery life.'
p180
g4

g4
sS"Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket."
p193
g2
sS'The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.'
p194
g4
sS'For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.'
p195

sS'A sound decision and a happy customer right here!'
p309
g4
sS"As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough."

p323
g4
sS"My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history."
p324
g4
sS'Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.'

g4

I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days..."

p336

p337
g2
sS'All in all, this is a wonderful device.'
p338
g2
sS'The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.'
p339
g2
sS"Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people."
p340
g4
sS'The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?'
p341
g2
sS'They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).'
p342
g4
sS"It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything."
p343
g4
sS'How did we listen to music before it?'
p344
g4
sS'The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.'
p345
g2
sS'It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.'
p346
g2
sS'The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.'
p347
g2
sS'I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.'

p349
g4
sS'The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.'
p350
g2
sS'In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.'
p351
g2
sS'However, you should still buy an iPod!'
p352
g4
sS'I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.'
p353
g4
sS'Pure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.'
p354
g4
sS'However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).'
p355
g4
sS'Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!'
p356
g2
sS'Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.'
p357
g4
sS'The other thing is the earbuds.'

p364
g4
sS'No big deal.'
p365

p366
g4
sS'I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.'
p367
g4
sS'If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.'
p368
g14
sS"The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick."
p369
g4
sS"Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again."
p370
g4
sS'Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.'
p371
g4
sS'The!  sound quality is great.'
p372
g2
sS"At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies."
p373
g4
sS'I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.'
p374
g4
sS'Buyer beware!'

p380
g4
sS'It all sounds great too.'
p381
g2
sS"Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!)."
p382
g4
sS"THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!"
p383
g4
sS"If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work."
p384
g4
sS'However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.'
p385
g14
sS"Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so."
p386
g4
sS'Just kidding.'
p387
g4
sS'Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.'
p388
g4
sS'I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I\'ve had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won\'t respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.'
p389
g4
sS"However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support."
p390
g4
sS'I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.'

g4
sS'Also, not liking the gel case.'
p397
g14
sS'You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.'

p401
g4
sS'Still my favorite MP3 player\t Is it overpriced ?'
p402
g4
sS'If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.'
p403
g4
sS'No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient'
p404
g14
sS'Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW'
p405
g4
sS'This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.'

p410
g14

p411
g4
sS'The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!'
p412
g4
sS'The sound is just fine.'
p413
g2
sS"I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!"

p418
g4
sS"Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once)."
p419
g4
sS'(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!'
p420
g2
sS'Yep, the iPod.'
p421
g4
sS'As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.'
