sS' For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.'
p3
g2
sS' Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.'
p4
g2
sS"IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up."
p5
g2
sS' I use it to listen to language tapes and to play "Earl" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.'
p6
g2
sS' I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.'
p7

sS' The product I rate five stars,'

g2
sS" I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it."
p11
g2
sS' The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe'
p12

sS"I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it."
p13
g2
sS'Match them pretty well to boot.'
p14
g2
sS'It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.'
p15
g2
sS' In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.'
p16
g9
sS'So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.'
p17
g9
sS'\tPure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.'
p18
g2
sS'  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.'
p19
g2
sS"That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product."
p20
g2
sS"I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying."
p21
g2
sS"There's got to be a better solution..."
p22
g2
sS' All in all, the good far outweighs the bad.'
p23
g2
sS" The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference)."
p24
g2
sS"  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G."
p25
g2
sS" Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once)."
p26
g2
sS'One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.'
p27
g2
sS" At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain."
p28
g2
sS" It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning."
p29
g2
sS' The first one I received skipped songs randomly.'
p30
g2
sS' CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier.'
p31
S'neg'
p32
sS'Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.'
p33
g2
sS'I like it.'
p34
g2
sS'That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.'
p35
g2
sS' The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.'
p36
g9
sS' I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.'
p37
g9
sS'Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy'
p38
g9
sS'. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.'
p39
g9
sS'Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.'
p40
g2
sS" That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB."
p41
g2
sS'Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!'
p42
g32
sS'iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.'
p43
g2
sS'iPod will change the way you enjoy music!'
p44
g2
sS"If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price."
p45
g2
sS"No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium."
p46
g32
sS' First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.'
p47
g32
sS'   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?'
p48
g2
sS'  It was worth it, as I use it to this very day.'
p49
g2
sS" However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety."
p50
g2
sS"  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need."
p51
g2
sS' For this reason, it is very easy to drop.'
p52
g2
sS'I Love My iPod!'
p53
g2
sS'The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.'
p54
g9
sS" the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company."
p55
g2
sS"I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly."
p56
g2
sS' This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual.'
p57
g9
sS' I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.'
p58
g2
sS' This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music.'
p59
g2
sS'THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.'
p60
g2
sS'I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.'
p61
g9
sS'Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.'
p62
g9
sS' My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter'
p63
g2
sS' The list is endless.'
p64
g2
sS'I love it.'
p65
g2
sS'Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.'
p66
g9
sS'Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.'
p67
g2
sS'  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.'
p68
g9
sS'i didnt touch the product.'
p69
g2
sS' I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.'
p70
g2
sS"I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me."
p71
g2
sS' You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.'
p72
g2
sS" Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked."
p73
g2
sS'Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years.'
p74
g2
sS"The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane."
p75
g2
sS" If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it."
p76
g2
sS"This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time."
p77
g9
sS"  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up."
p78
g2
sS"In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!"
p79
g2
sS'However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.'
p80
g32
sS"Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one."
p81
g2
sS" I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference."
p82
g2
sS"I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it."
p83
g2
sS'Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.'
p84
g2
sS"Confused yet? Don't be."
p85
g2
sS'  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.'
p86
g2
sS"Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...\t I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio."
p87
g2
sS' All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.'
p88
g9
sS"First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable."
p89
g32
sS' PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.'
p90
g2
sS'  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.'
p91
g2
sS' One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.'
p92
g32
sS'Two DVDs to capture all 2,400 tracks.'
p93
g2
sS' Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.'
p94
g2
sS"  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload."
p95
g2
sS'  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.'
p96
g9
sS'I have an ipod and it is a great buy.'
p97
g9
sS'This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.'
p98
g9
sS'Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.'
p99
g2
sS'Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?'
p100
g2
sS"  *\tYou can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *"
p101
g32
sS'After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.'
p102
g2
sS"Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple."
p103
g2
sS' I disagree.'
p104
g2
sS"I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds."
p105
g2
sS'No need to install the iTunes.'
p106
g2
sS'I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.'
p107
g2
sS"The iPod's battery, 1.5 years."
p108
g2
sS'Yeah, pretty weak.'
p109
g2
sS".  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market."
p110
g2
sS'  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.'
p111
g32
sS'Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.'
p112
g2
sS'  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.'
p113
g2
sS' Overall, this product is AWESOME.'
p114
g9
sS' Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.'
p115
g9
sS'A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.'
p116
g2
sS" This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best."
p117
g2
sS' You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!'
p118
g2
sS' Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.'
p119
g2
sS' The interface took a little getting used to.'
p120
g32
sS'Good, But Not For Everyone'
p121
g2
sS"I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money."
p122
g2
sS"Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!"
p123
g32
sS" But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off."
p124
g2
sS"Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics."
p125
g2
sS'So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.'
p126
g2
sS'  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.'
p127
g9
sS'But enought of the negativity.'
p128
g2
sS"Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use."
p129
g9
sS'  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.'
p130
g2
sS'  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.'
p131
g2
sS' Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.'
p132
g9
sS' I would strongly recommend you get one !!'
p133
g2
sS"*\tThe 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *"
p134
g2
sS' Really easy to use.'
p135
g9
sS"It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover."
p136
g2
sS'  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.'
p137
g2
sS'Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?'
p138
g2
sS"But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear."
p139
g2
sS'The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.'
p140
g9
sS" I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory."
p141
g2
sS"Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most."
p142
g2
sS" I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that."
p143
g2
sS'It allows fast and easy navigation.'
p144
g2
sS" Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products)."
p145
g2
sS" They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices."
p146
g9
sS'Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.'
p147
g2
sS' The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.'
p148
g9
sS' The only problem is the battery life.'
p149
g32
sS"It's a good way to pass the time."
p150
g2
sS'Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.'
p151
g2
sS'I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.'
p152
g2
sS'I use my iPod all the time.'
p153
g2
sS'Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.'
p154
g9
sS' The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.'
p155
g2
sS'The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.'
p156
g9
sS' As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.'
p157
g32
sS'However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.'
p158
g2
sS' Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.'
p159
g32
sS"For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in."
p160
g2
sS'It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.'
p161
g2
sS"Don't get this...keep browsing."
p162
g2
sS'The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes).'
p163
g2
sS' Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.'
p164
g9
sS" With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive."
p165
g9
sS'They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.'
p166
g2
sS' Has a great helpline.'
p167
g9
sS'There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.'

sS' I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !'
p169
g2
sS"iRiver's battery lasts four to five years."
p170
g2
sS'  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.'
p171
g2
sS" Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)"
p172
g2
sS' The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.'
p173
g2
sS' Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!'
p174
g2
sS' I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation.'
p175
g2
sS' No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient'
p176
g32
sS'  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.'
p177
g2
sS' I wish I had a long time ago.'
p178
g2
sS'In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.'
p179
g32
sS" I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection."
p180
g2
sS" Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now."
p181
g2
sS' If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!'
p182
g2
sS' But is it worth all the hype?'
p183
g2
sS'While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.'
p184
g2
sS'When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging.'
p185
g2
sS'You can transfer music from one PC to the other.'
p186
g2
sS" I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model."
p187
g2
sS' Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.'
p188
g2
sS"Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket."
p189
g9
sS' It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.'
p190
g2
sS' Way to go Apple!'
p191
g9
sS' The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.'
p192
g9
sS"The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches."
p193
g32
sS'For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.'
p194
g9
sS" And I'm really not that rough with things!"
p195
g2
sS" Doesn't have alot of good games on it."
p196
g32
sS'Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.'
p197
g2
sS' This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).'
p198
g2
sS" As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough."
p199
g9
sS'but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.'
p200
g32
sS'Amazing.'
p201
g2
sS'  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.'
p202
g9
sS'I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.'
p203
g9
sS' Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.'
p204
g9
sS' The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.'
p205
g9
sS' I am a total iPod addict.'
p206
g2
sS'  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.'
p207
g2
sS'Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?'
p208
g2
sS'I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.'
p209
g9
sS' Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.'
p210
g2
sS' In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.'
p211

sS' What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?'
p216
g2
sS'The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).'
p217

p218
g2
sS" It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes."
p219
g2
sS' I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.'
p220
g2
sS" Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time."
p221
g2
sS'Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.'
p222
g2
sS'  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini'

p224
g2
sS'The bass is deep and the treble is clear.'
p225

sS" Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal."
p238
g2
sS" held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'."
p239
g2
sS'then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.'
p240
g2
sS"There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago."
p241
g2
sS'This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.'
p242
g2
sS'There\'s even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.'
p243
g9
sS' The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).'
p244
g2
sS'God Save Apple\t I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.'
p245
g2
sS"This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore."
p246
g2
sS"  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one."
p247
g9
sS"A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general."
p248
g2
sS"  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again."
p249
g2

p255
g2

p256
g2
sS'I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!'
p257
g2
sS' I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!'
p258
g2
sS' The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.'
p259
g2
sS'Also, I don\'t like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.'
p260
g2
sS'  Again, another hassle.'
p261
g2
sS'Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead\t If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.'
p262

p263
g2
sS"  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!"

sS' Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.'
p265
g32
sS" the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs."
p266
g2
sS'  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.'
p267
g9
sS" I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt."
p268
g9
sS"The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement')."
p269
g32
sS'The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.'
p270
g2
sS' With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.'
p271
g2
sS"  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life)."
p272
g2
sS'This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.'
p273
g32
sS"  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software."
p274
g2
sS' I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.'
p275
g2
sS' Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market.'
p276
g9
sS' While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.'
p277
g2
sS" The user support service isn't too great either."
p278
g32
sS'I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.'
p279
g2
sS"You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue."
p280
g2
sS'The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.'
p281
g9
sS" It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better."
p282
g2
sS'So far it has worked out great\t I'
p283
g2
sS" It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky."
p284
g2
sS'If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.'
p285
g2
sS'  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.'
p286
g9
sS" So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days..."
p287
g2
sS' they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.'
p288
g2
sS' The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.'
p289
g2
sS"Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services."
p290
g32
sS'Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.'
p291
g2
sS'  It all sounds great too.'
p292
g9
sS'The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.'
p293
g2
sS"You've earned a new fan."
p294
g2
sS' Pros Holds a ton of music.'
p295
g2
sS'Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.'
p296
g2

p297
g9
sS'Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.'
p298
g2
sS' The sound is just fine.'
p299
g9
sS'I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.'
p300
g2
sS'The music MUST be on your computer.'
p301
g2
sS'This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y'
p302
g2
sS' Still my favorite MP3 player\t Is it overpriced ?'
p303
g2
sS'However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.'
p304
g2
sS' There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.'
p305
g2
sS'First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."'
p306
g2
sS'Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.'
p307
g2
sS'  Cons Breaks easily.'
p308
g32
sS'Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.'
p309
g9
sS' I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.'
p310
g2
sS' BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.'
p311
g32
sS' Hence, the one star rating...'
p312
g2
sS" However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support."
p313
g2
sS' FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.'
p314
g9
sS'But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.'
p315
g2
sS' If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.'
p316
g2
sS" The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it."
p317
g2
sS' Battery non-issue.'
p318
g9
sS'  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.'
p319
g9
sS' There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.'
p320
g32
sS' The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.'
p321
g2
sS'But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.'
p322
g2
sS"My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history."
p323
g2
sS' You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed.'
p324
g2
sS'As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me.'
p325
g2
sS'Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.'
p326
g9
sS'Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.'
p327
g9
sS"At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's."
p328
g2
sS' The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.'
p329
g2
sS" Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer."
p330
g2
sS'As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.'
p331
g32
sS'I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out'
p332
g9
sS' We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.'
p333
g32
sS"  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong."
p334
g32
sS'All in all, this is a wonderful device.'
p335
g9
sS' Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).'
p336
g2
sS"Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people."
p337
g2
sS'The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?'
p338
g9
sS'They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).'
p339
g2
sS' You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.'
p340
g9
sS"It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything."
p341
g2
sS' Very sturdy and strong.'
p342
g9
sS'  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.'
p343
g2
sS'  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.'
p344
g2
sS'It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.'
p345
g9
sS' Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.'
p346
g9
sS" These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one."
p347
g9
sS' After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.'
p348
g2
sS' i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.'
p349
g2
sS'Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.'
p350
g2
sS' Needless to say, these are fragile machines.'
p351
g2
sS'However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).'
p352
g2
sS"  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device."
p353
g2
sS' I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.'
p354
g2
sS'Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!'
p355
g9
sS' I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.'
p356
g2
sS'  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.'
p357
g2
sS' I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.'
p358
g2
sS" I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos."
p359
g2
sS' Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.'
p360
g9
sS' To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com  ##Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.'
p361
g2
sS'No big deal.'
p362
g2
sS'  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)'
p363
g2
sS' Yep, the iPod.'
p364
g2
sS"I'm still figuring out why."
p365
g2
sS'If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.'
p366
g32
sS' You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.'
p367
g2
sS'  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:'
p368
g2
sS'  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.'
p369
g2
sS"At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies."
p370
g2
sS' This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.'
p371
g2
sS" I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400."
p372
g2
sS'Buyer beware!'
p373
g2
sS"And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive."
p374
g2
sS" The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc."
p375
g9
sS' The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.'
p376
g2
sS"  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!"
p377
g2
sS' Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.'
p378
g32
sS'buyers BEWARE!'
p379
g2
sS'when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!'
p380
g2
sS"  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works."
p381
g2
sS'The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.'
p382
g9
sS"Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!)."
p383
g2
sS'I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.'
p384
g9
sS' Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.'
p385
g32
sS' The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.'
p386
g32
sS' The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.'
p387
g2
sS"Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so."
p388
g2
sS' Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing'
p389
g32
sS'  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.'
p390
g2
sS' You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1'
p391
g2
sS"I don't really intend to drop mine to find out."
p392
g2
sS'Very Pleased.'
p393
g2
sS"  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up."
p394
g32
sS' However, with the iPod you cannot.'
p395
g2
sS'You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.'
p396
g2
sS' The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.'
p397
g2
sS' the packing inside was in tatters.'
p398
g2
sS'Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW'
p399
g2
sS" The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days)."
p400
g9
sS" I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands."
p401
g2
sS'This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.'
p402
g2
sS'It was worth the wait.'
p403
g2
sS'The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.'
p404
g2
sS' a week passed but it was never picked up.'
p405
g2
sS"  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music."
p406
g2
sS" The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable."
p407
g2
sS" There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't."
p408
g32
sS"Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE."
p409
g32
sS'The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!'
p410
g2
sS"Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything."
p411
g9
sS'   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.'
p412
g2
sS' Also, not liking the gel case.'
p413
g32
sS"The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym."
p414
g9
sS"  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative."
p415
g32
sS" I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!"
p416
g2
sS" FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature."
p417
g32
sS'  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.'
p418
g2
sS'The first battery charge lasted only about six hours.'
p419
g2
sS" My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages."
p420
