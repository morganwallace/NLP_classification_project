p8
g4
sS'Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.'
p9
g2
sS"It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break."
p10
g4
sS'Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.'
p11
g2
sS'I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!'
p12
g2
sS'The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.'
p13
g4
sS'The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.'
p14
g7
sS'But, for the money it is a good machine.'
p15
g4
sS"It doesn't bog down under load."
p16
g4

p19
g4
sS"Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars)."
p20
g7
sS'Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.'
p21
g4
sS'The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.'
p22
g2
sS'I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.'
p23
g2

p24
g4
sS"I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one."
p25

p26
g7

p27
g2
sS'Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.'
p28
g7
sS'The soft start is nice.'
p29
g4
sS'This router was a huge disapointment.'
p30

sS'All in all I am pleased with the router.'
p31
g4
sS'Overall it is a great value.'
p32
g4
sS'I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.'
p33
g4
sS'I like the speed control.'
p34
g4
sS'It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.'
p35
g4
sS'It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.'
p36
g7
sS'I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.'

g4
sS'I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.'
p39
g2
sS'I do woodworking as a serious hobby.'
p40
g2
sS'It has plenty of power.'
p41
g4
sS'I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.'
p42
g4
sS'I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.'
p43
g2
sS'Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).'
p44
g2
sS'Because of this I have removed the handles.'
p45
g2
sS'I would put the Hitachi up with the best!'
p46
g4
sS'This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.'
p47
g2
sS'I have many others in the past.'

g7
sS'The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.'
p50
g4
sS'One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.'

sS'I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.'
p52

sS'Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.'

g2
sS'This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.'
p54
g4
sS'At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.'
p55
g2
sS'I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.'
p56
g2
sS'On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.'
p57
g4
sS"The owner had three routers - all M12's."
p58
g2
sS"It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation."
p59
g7
sS'The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.'
p60
g4
sS'I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!'
p61
g4
sS'I make furniture and cabinetry.'
p62
g2
sS"This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine."
p63
g4
sS'Until recently it was my only router.'
p64
g2
sS'This is a well-made and powerful tool.'
p65
g4
sS'I purchased two of these beauties.'
p66
g4
sS'If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.'
p67
g7
sS'I really liked the price...'
p68
g4
sS"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty."
p69
g7
sS'It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.'
p70
g4
sS'This is a fantastic tool to use.'
p71
g4
sS'My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.'
p72
g7
sS"I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!"
p73
g2
sS'It works well with the larger bits.'
p74
g2
sS"Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos."
p75
g4
sS'It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.'
p76
g2
sS'What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.'
p77
g4
sS'The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.'
p78
g7
sS"As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them."
p79
g2
sS'The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.'
p80
g4
sS'But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.'
p81
g2
sS"It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router."
p82
g2
sS"Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price"
p83
g4
sS'I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn\'t even slow down.'
p84
g4
sS'I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.'
p85
g4
sS'In my table the M12V has been a real champ.'
p86
g4
sS'After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.'
p87
g4
sS'I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.'
p88
g2
sS'Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.'
p89
g4
sS'Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.'
p90
g2
sS'I use it on a router table, and it is works well.'
p91
g4
sS'Happy woodworking!!'
p92
g2
sS'The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.'
p93
g4
sS'At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.'
p94
g2
sS'Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.'
p95
g2
sS'1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.'
p96
g7
sS'Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.'
p97
g4
sS'Good luck and cut wood!!!!'
p98
g2
sS'Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.'
p99
g2
sS'Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.'
p100
g4
sS'Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.'
p101
g2
sS'You must keep double checking depths.'
p102
g7
sS'It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.'
p103
g7
sS'Smooth plunging mechanism.'
p104
g4
sS'I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.'
p105
g7
sS'I used this router to plow out 3" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.'
p106
g2
sS'Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.'
p107
g2
sS'The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.'
p108
g2
sS'The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)'
p109
g4
sS"It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great."
p110
g4
sS'I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.'
p111
g2
sS'I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.'
p112
g2
sS'The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.'
p113
g2
sS'I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.'
p114
g7
sS'Enjoy.'
p115
g4
sS'The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.'
p116
g7
sS'With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).'
p117
g7
sS'She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.'
p118
g2
sS'For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.'
p119
g4
sS'I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.'
p120
g7
sS'It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).'
p121
g2
sS'I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.'
p122
g2
sS'Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.'
p123
g4
sS'And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.'
p124
g2
sS"I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut."
p125
g4
sS'If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!'
p126
g7
sS'The sliding latch is does not stay in place.'
p127
g7
sS"The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well."
p128
g7
sS'I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.'
p129
g2
sS"I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work."
p130
g2
sS'I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.'
p131
g7
sS'I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.'
p132
g2
sS'This is an excellent router for the money.'
p133
g4
sS'This is an excellent router for the price.'
p134
g4
sS'Then, without warning, it took off again.'
p135
g2
sS'When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.'
p136
g4
sS'They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.'
p137
g4
sS'The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.'
p138
g4
sS'I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.'
p139
g7
sS'As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.'
p140
g2
sS'My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.'
p141
g2
sS'I never could get the panel bit to fit right.'
p142
g2
sS"I think I'll go rout something..."
p143
g2
sS'Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.'
p144
g7
sS'Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.'
p145
g2
sS'I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.'
p146
g4
sS"Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it."
p147
g4
sS"I'll be getting a second one for my router table!"
p148
g4
sS'I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.'
p149
g2
sS"I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability."
p150
g4
sS'Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.'
p151
g4
sS"After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy."
p152
g2
sS'I have 5 routers, I use them all!'
p153
g2
sS'Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.'
p154
g7
sS'This router appeared in my wife\'s gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.'
p155
g2
sS'The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.'
p156
g4
sS'This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.'
p157
g2
sS"Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well."
p158
g7
sS"Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router."
p159
g4
sS'The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.'
p160
g4
sS'Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.'
p161
g4
sS'I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.'
p162
g2
sS'Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.'
p163
g2
sS'Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.'
p164
g4
sS'The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.'
p165
g4
sS'The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.'
p166
g4
sS'The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.'
p167
g7
sS"The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site."
p168
g2
sS'It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.'
p169
g4
sS'Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.'
p170
g2
sS"For the money, I'm not sure you can do better."
p171
g4
sS'Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.'
p172
g7
sS'I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn\'t skip a beat.'
p173
g4
sS'I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.'
p174
g7
sS'My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.'
p175
g2
sS'I bought it!'
p176
g2
sS'I love the performance and features of this router.'
p177
g4
sS'I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.'
p178
g4
sS'I must have gotten a good one.'
p179
g4
sS'The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.'
p180
g7
sS"If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers.."
p181
g7
sS"The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router."
p182
g4
sS'Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.'
p183
g7
sS'They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.'
p184
g7
sS"The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will."
p185
g7
sS'The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.'
p186
g7
sS'Now I need to get some 1/2" bits...'
p187
g2
sS'Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.'
p188
g2
sS"If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget."
p189
g4
sS"It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up."
p190
g7
sS"I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well."
p191
g2
sS"However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it."
p192
g2
sS'However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).'
p193
g7
sS'The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.'
p194
g4
sS'There are a few points of contention which I have.'
p195
g2
sS"The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits."
p196
g2
sS'The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.'
p197
g7
sS'The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.'
p198
g2
sS"I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder."
p199
g4
sS'It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)'
p200
g2
sS"I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!"
p201
g4
sS'The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.'
p202
g7
sS'I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.'
p203
g2
sS"The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service."
p204
g2
sS'I looked at this router and bought a Makita.'
p205
g2
sS'This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.'
p206
g4
sS"I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees."
p207
g2
sS'Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering'
p208
g2
sS"I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal."
p209
g2
sS'The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.'
p210
g4
sS'This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.'
p211
g2
sS'The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.'
p212
g4
sS'I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.'
p213
g2
sS'The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.'
p214
g7
sS'Only problem is that is a bit heavy.'
p215
g7
sS'It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.'
p216
g4
sS'I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.'
p217
g4
sS"I couldn't believe what I had been missing."
p218
g4
sS"For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy."
p219
g4
sS'That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.'
p220
g7
sS'I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.'
p221
g2
sS'I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years.'
p222
g2
sS'First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.'
p223
g2
sS'I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.'
p224
g4
sS'This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.'
p225
g4
sS'Cuts are easy and smooth.'
p226
g4
sS'All in all, not very good.'
p227
g7
sS'I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.'
p228
g7
sS'I would however highly recommend the m12v router !'
p229
g4
sS'Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.'
p230
g4
sS'LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:'
p231
g2
sS'The height adjustment works well- not perfect.'
p232
g4
sS'The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.'
p233
g4
sS"My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist."
p234
g7
sS'But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.'
p235
g4
sS'Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.'
p236
g7
sS"I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it."
p237
g2
sS"Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance."
p238
g7
sS'The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.'
p239
g4
sS'Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.'
p240
g4
sS'Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.'
p241
g7
sS'This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.'
p242
g4
sS'It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.'

sS'Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.'
p244
g2
sS'It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.'
p245
g7
sS'For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.'
p246
g4
sS'Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.'
p247
g4
sS'UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.'
p248
g4
sS'I prefer things that are simple.'
p249
g4
sS'I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.'
p250
g2
sS'I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.'
p251
g2
sS'I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.'
p252
g4
sS"So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that."
p253
g4
sS'From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.'
p254
g4
sS'The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.'
p255
g7
sS'I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).'
p256
g2
sS'I did like the heft of the machine.'
p257
g4
sS'What an upgrade!!!'
p258
g4
sS'The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.'
p259
g2
sS'Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.'
p260
g2
sS'Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.'
p261
g4
sS"I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do."
p262
g4
sS'I use these routers under a table.'
p263
g2
sS"If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router."
p264
g2
sS'I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.'
p265
g2
sS'(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).'
p266
g2
sS'Those are the good points.'
p267
g2
sS'I don\'t have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven\'t tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .'
p268
g4
sS'Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.'
p269
g7
sS'The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn\'t use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.'
p270
g2
sS"I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it."
p271
g4
sS'Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.'
p272
g4
sS"I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it."
p273
g4
sS'But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.'
p274
g4
sS'Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)'
p275
g2
sS'2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.'
p276
g2
sS'Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping'
p277
g7
sS'Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.'
p278
g2
sS'I have owned this router for nearly five years.'
p279
g2
sS'I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.'
p280
g7
sS'I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.'
p281
g7
sS'It will take 31/2 inchers now.'
p282
g2
sS"If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away."
p283
g2
sS'I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.'
p284
g2
sS'If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.'
p285
g7
sS'After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.'
p286

p287
g2
sS"You just can't go wrong with this one!"
p288
g4
sS'Why do people spend all that money on accessories to "raise and lower " the router in a table??? A waste of money.'
p289
g2

p291
g7
sS"For the price I don't think you can beat it."
p292
g4
sS'It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.'
p293
g4
sS'I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.'
p294
g2
sS'In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.'

g4
sS'It is quiet and has plenty of power.'
p297
g4

g4
sS"The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole."

g4

p302

p303
g4

p304
g4
sS'Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.'
p305
g2
sS'This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.'
p306
g2
