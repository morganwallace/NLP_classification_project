S'Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.'
p1
S'neg'
p2
sS'I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.'
p3
g2
sS'First, I turned off my cable modem.'
p4
S'neutral'
p5
sS'My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.'
p6
g5
sS'I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.'
p7
g2
sS'Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.'
p8
g5
sS"On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade."
p9
S'pos'
p10
sS'Why they brought this to market is beyond me.'
p11
g5
sS"While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system."
p12
g5
sS'Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.'
p13
g5
sS"I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual)."
p14
g5
sS'There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.'
p15
g2
sS'If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.'
p16
g5
sS'There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.'
p17
g2
sS"And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!"
p18
g2
sS'Blessedly, my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop.'
p19
g5
sS'To say that it is "buggy" would be the world\'s most profound understatement.'
p20
g5
sS'I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.'
p21
g5
sS'I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.'
p22
g5
sS'In "Add/Remove, you must selecting the program\'s Change button.'
p23
g5
sS'For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.'
p24
g5
sS'I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.'
p25
g2
sS"I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package."
p26
g5
sS'The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.'
p27
g2
sS"We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great."
p28
g10
sS"I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either."
p29
g2
sS'Since then, I have had one problem after another.'
p30
g5
sS"The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions."
p31
g2
sS'Wish I had.'
p32
g5
sS'I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.'
p33
g5
sS'I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.'
p34
g5
sS"You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks."
p35
g10
sS'They use to be so useful and neceesary.'
p36
g5
sS'An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.'
p37
g5
sS'Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!'
p38
g2
sS'Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.'
p39
g2
sS'Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.'
p40
g2
sS'It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).'
p41
g2
sS'I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.'
p42
g5
sS'I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.'
p43
g2
sS'Buy ZONE Alarm.'
p44
g5
sS'The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn\'t worth it.'
p45
g5
sS"And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam."
p46
g5
sS'They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install.'
p47
g5
sS'There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.'
p48
g5
sS'Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.'
p49
g5
sS"Here's why:"
p50
g5
sS'But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.'
p51
g5
sS'The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.'
p52
g5
sS"It's become tedious doing this."
p53
g5
sS'Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!'
p54
g2
sS'First, it serious, serious installation problems.'
p55
g2
sS'Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.'
p56
g2
sS'So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!'
p57
g5
sS"When all was said and done, I couldn't even use Microsoft Outlook."
p58
g5
sS'Okay, how can I say this nicely?'
p59
g5
sS'As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).'
p60
g2
sS'It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.'
p61
g2
sS'All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.'
p62
g5
sS'I tried it again this morning and it said I didn\'t have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.'
p63
g2
sS'This product has virtually all the same installation problems.'
p64
g2
sS'The biggest problem is the installation.'
p65
g2
sS'Seems to work great.'
p66
g10
sS'We were leary to say the least, but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt.'
p67
g5
sS'To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.'
p68
g2
sS'The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.'
p69
g10
sS'No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.'
p70
g2
sS'Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.'
p71
g5
sS'Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.'
p72
g5
sS"While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time."
p73
g10
sS'Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.'
p74
g5
sS'I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.'
p75
g2
sS'The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.'
p76
g10
sS"Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect."
p77
g2
sS"But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts."
p78
g2
sS"Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program."
p79
g5
sS"Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too."
p80
g10
sS'I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)'
p81
g5
sS'Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.'
p82
g2
sS"It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!"
p83
g5
sS"The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars."
p84
g2
sS'5 stars all the way!'
p85
g10
sS'HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.'
p86
g2
sS'After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.'
p87
g2
sS"I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions."
p88
g2
sS'Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.'
p89
g2
sS'Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.'
p90
g2
sS'If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).'
p91
g5
sS'The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.'
p92
g5
sS"Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions."
p93
g5
sS'These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.'
p94
g10
sS'It was a Symantec error.'
p95
g2
sS'Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.'
p96
g10
sS'If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.'
p97
g5
sS'When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!'
p98
g2
sS"The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses."
p99
g5
sS"What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!"
p100
g2
sS'I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.'
p101
g2
sS'At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!'
p102
g5
sS'Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.'
p103
g5
sS'Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).'
p104
g10
sS"I can't recommend their programs enough."
p105
g5
sS'It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.'
p106
g5
sS"The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --"
p107
g10
sS'Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.'
p108
g5
sS'Anti-Spam is Good'
p109
g5
sS"The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem."
p110
g2
sS'I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional.'
p111
g5
sS'Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.'
p112
g5
sS'I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.'
p113
g5
sS'I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.'
p114
g5
sS'By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.'
p115
g10
sS"THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE."
p116
g5
sS'This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.'
p117
g10
sS'Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)'
p118
g5
sS'(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)'
p119
g5
sS'I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs.'
p120
g5
sS'Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.'
p121
g2
sS'The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.'
p122
g5
sS'Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.'
p123
g2
sS"I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products."
p124
g2
sS'I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.'
p125
g5
sS'I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).'
p126
g10
sS'I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.'
p127
g2
sS'This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.'
p128
g5
sS'Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.'
p129
g2
sS'So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.'
p130
g10
sS'There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.'
p131
g2
sS'Well, no more.'
p132
g5
sS'I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.'
p133
g5
sS"I've seen many reviews praising 2003 and cursing 2004."
p134
g5
sS"I don't have one good thing to say."
p135
g5
sS"And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority."
p136
g2
sS'Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)'
p137
g10
sS"It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use."
p138
g5
sS'This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.'
p139
g10
sS'It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.'
p140
g10
sS'I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.'
p141
g5
sS'Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).'
p142
g2
sS'I am glad that I do not work for Norton.'
p143
g2
sS'The tests were right.'
p144
g5
sS"Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one."
p145
g2
sS'I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.'
p146
g2
sS"Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem."
p147
g5
sS'After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...'
p148
g2
sS'And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.'
p149
g10
sS'First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.'
p150
g2
sS"Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well)."
p151
g5
sS"This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?"
p152
g5
sS'The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.'
p153
g2
sS'Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.'
p154
g5
sS'I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.'
p155
g2
sS'I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.'
p156
g5
sS'Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.'
p157
g2
sS'I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.'
p158
g5
sS'I was totally baffled.'
p159
g5
sS'This is a very full featured product.'
p160
g5
sS'Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.'
p161
g2
sS"It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory."
p162
g5
sS"For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program."
p163
g5
sS"So, we're fed up."
p164
g5
sS'After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.'
p165
g5
sS"But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate."
p166
g2
sS"While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security."
p167
g5
sS"As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec."
p168
g2
sS'No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.'
p169
g10
sS'Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.'
p170
g2
sS'Stay away from this product!'
p171
g2
sS'Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.'
p172
g2
sS'Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.'
p173
g2
sS"We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)"
p174
g5
sS'They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!'
p175
g5
sS'But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.'
p176
g10
sS'A security software suite with lots of value'
p177
g5
sS'HMMMM.. Good luck.'
p178
g5
sS'After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.'
p179
g5
sS'But those 2 come up every time.'
p180
g2
sS'And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.'
p181
g5
sS'It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)'
p182
g2
sS'I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.'
p183
g10
sS'It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates.'
p184
g5
sS"We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles."
p185
g5
sS'I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.'
p186
g5
sS'Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.'
p187
g2
sS'My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.'
p188
g2
sS'After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.'
p189
g2
sS"I'll update my review if I find out otherwise."
p190
g5
sS'Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.'
p191
g10
sS'Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.'
p192
g2
sS'After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.'
p193
g5
sS'I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.'
p194
g5
sS"I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years."
p195
g5
sS'While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.'
p196
g2
sS'I really liked the firewall.'
p197
g5
sS"Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again..."
p198
g5
sS'I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.'
p199
g2
sS"They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall."
p200
g5
sS"Nice little racket they've got there."
p201
g5
sS'PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.'
p202
g10
sS'Avoid at all costs'
p203
g5
sS'It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.'
p204
g10
sS'Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.'
p205
g2
sS"After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful."
p206
g2
sS'Had to uninstall it.'
p207
g5
sS'The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.'
p208
g2
sS"Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription."
p209
g5
sS"Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low."
p210
g10
sS'I decided to give it one last chance... so I formatted my hard drive, reinstalled Windows XP (which also required a day & night download/install of SP2 on dial-up) and put NIS2004 back onto the computer.'
p211
g5
sS"I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004."
p212
g2
sS'However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.'
p213
g2
sS'Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.'
p214
g5
sS'I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.'
p215
g10
sS'Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.'
p216
g5

p217
g2
sS'I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.'
p218
g2
sS'I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.'
p219
g2
sS'The customer support is pathetic.'
p220
g2
sS'So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program.'
p221
g5
sS'I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop!'

g5

p228
g10
sS"We'd have probably tried McAffee, but I hear from reviews that it has troubles too."
p229
g5
sS'I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!'
p230
g2

p234
g10
sS'I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.'
p235
g5
sS'This is also the case with NIS 2004.'
p236
g10
sS'For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.'

p321
g5
sS'This product is absolutely not ready for release.'
p322
g2
sS"Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it."
p323
g2
sS'However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.'
p324
g2
sS'The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.'
p325
g5
sS"I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus."
p326
g5
sS"I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely."

p333
g2
sS'I followed the instructions to the letter.'
p334
g5
sS"I didn't have any major problems installing this software."
p335
g10
sS'I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.'
p336
g5
sS'Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.'
p337
g2
sS"All in all it hasn't been a bad product."
p338
g10
sS'I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.'
p339
g2
sS'So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.'
p340
g5
sS'Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.'
p341
g10

sS'Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?'
p343
g2
sS'The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.'
p344
g5
sS'Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!'
p345
g5
sS'I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!'
p346
g2
sS"The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did."
p347
g5
sS"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98."
p348
g10
sS'My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.'
p349
g5

g2
sS'WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.'
p351

sS'Booting up my computer took forever!!!'
p352
g2
sS"I've tried lots of things they suggest."
p353
g5
sS'Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.'
p354
g2
sS"I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version."
p355
g5
sS'BEWARE!!!!'
p356
g5
sS'Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.'
p357
g5
sS'This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.'
p358
g2
sS'I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.'

p367
g2
sS'I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.'
p368
g2
sS'Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.'
p369
g2
sS"Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there."
p370
g5
sS"If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest."
p371
g5
sS'Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.'
p372
g10
sS'I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the'
p373
